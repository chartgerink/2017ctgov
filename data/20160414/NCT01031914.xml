    <textblock>
      The purpose of this engineering trial is to develop and validate an algorithm that will
      deliver Paced Breathing as a ramp feature to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects using
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. In this trial the investigators will be
      evaluating the algorithm's ability to correctly distinguish between sleep and wake.

    <description>We tested the ability of the Sleep/Wake algorithm to identify sleep an wake periods with precision, as compared to standard polysonography (PSG) measures, which was used as the gold standard, i.e. we tested the accuracy of the algorithm. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives)in the population and it was assesed using as 2 X 2 table, i.e. accuracy = number of true positives + number of true negatives/ number of true positives + false positives + false negatives +true negatives. where True positive = the algorithm tested correctly identified sleep, False positive = the algorithm tested incorrectly identified sleep, True negative = the algorithm tested correctly rejected awake periods, and False negative = the algorithm tested incorrectly rejected awake periods.</description>

    <description>The Paced Breathing (PB) feature(when activated) will work to relax the user and help them fall asleep by encouraging them to take deep slow breaths until they reach 10 breaths (or less) per minute. The feature will also detect when the subject has fallen asleep so the Continuous Positive Airway Pressur (CPAP) device will automatically switch from PB mode to regular CPAP mode.</description>
