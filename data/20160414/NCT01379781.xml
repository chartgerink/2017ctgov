      Postpartum depression (PPD) is undertreated and the consequences of this are substantial for
      women and children. Studies show that infant cry/fuss and sleep behavior are associated with
      PPD, and that parenting interventions can change infant behavior, yet these findings have
      never been applied to PPD. In this study, the investigators are teaching parenting skills to
      increase infant nocturnal sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior to women likely to develop PPD
      to see if the investigators can prevent the onset of this disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the over 4 million live births each year in the United States, nearly 800,000 — or 20% —
      of the mothers will develop major or minor depression within the first 3 months postpartum.
      This number dwarfs prevalence rates for gestational diabetes (2-5%) and preterm birth
      (12.7%). Existing clinical approaches to postpartum depression (PPD) use standard
      pharmacologic and psychological interventions to reduce women's symptoms. Nevertheless, PPD
      is undertreated, in part because women are reluctant to seek treatment due to stigma
      associated with mental health care and disinclination to take psychotropic medications when
      breastfeeding. The consequences of this are substantial. Untreated PPD is associated with
      diminished quality of life and significant emotional suffering for women, and, through
      compromised caregiving, poor outcomes in children's cognitive and social-emotional
      development. Although maternal risk factors for PPD are well known, protocols for prevention
      based on commonly used depression interventions are only beginning to be evaluated. Building
      on developmental data showing the profound bi-directionality of emotional and behavioral
      influences between mother and infant, the investigators are testing a novel PPD intervention
      protocol that challenges the standard, individually-focused treatment paradigm. Our
      intervention is based on the conceptualization of PPD as a potential disorder of the dyad,
      and one that can be approached through behavioral change in and affective engagement with
      mother and child. Studies show that infant cry/fuss and sleep behavior are associated with
      PPD, and that parenting interventions can change infant behavior, yet these findings have
      never been applied to PPD. The investigators aim to collect data on a novel PPD
      risk-reducing protocol based on a dyadic behavioral approach to PPD in which the
      investigators treat at-risk women by promoting maternally-mediated behavioral changes in
      their infants. The investigators will select a sample of pregnant women at risk for PPD,
      teach parenting skills to increase infant nocturnal sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior to
      half of the sample during 3 perinatal visits, then evaluate infant behavior at 6 and 14
      weeks, and maternal mood at 6, 10, and 14 weeks postpartum. The investigators will fully
      exploit the investigative opportunities of this intervention study by using state-of-the-art
      EEG and fetal monitoring to characterize early biomarkers associated with infant behavior
      and behavior change. This study has the potential to have a major impact on clinical
      research, and to transform the standard care of PPD in that (1) the intervention will have
      high rates of treatment compliance because (a) the protocol sessions can be incorporated
      into usual perinatal medical visits, (b) parenting skills will appeal to women as a
      non-psychiatric intervention, (c) the clinical approach will have face validity given the
      dyadic focus of the perinatal period; (2) its aim is prevention; (3) it fosters both
      maternal and child well being; (4) it will expand the risk factors for PPD to include
      neurobehavioral markers in the perinate.

13 items are scored on a 5 point scale ranging from 0=not present to 4=severe
11 items are scored from 0-2
A composite score is created by the sum of the scores from all items. Scores can range from 0-74
0-7: normal
8-13: mild depression
14-18: moderate depression
19-23: severe depression

24 questions
13 items are scored on a 5 point scale ranging from 0=not present to 4=severe
11 items are scored from 0-2
A composite score is created by the sum of the scores from all items. Scores can range from 0-74
0-7: normal
8-13: mild depression
14-18: moderate depression
19-23: severe depression
24: very severe depression
Higher summed values indicate a greater severity of depression</description>
