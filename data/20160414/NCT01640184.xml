  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is difficulty for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in the chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) patients who had not succeeded medical therapy and could not get
      parathyroidectomy. The investigators suppose that ultrasonic ablation may be a valuable
      alternative treatment that help control secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients
      presenting with enlarged parathyroid gland(s) visible at ultrasonography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD), including those who are undergoing long-term dialysis treatments. sHPT is damaged for
      bone system, blood system, cardiovascular system, and so on. The treatment of the sHPT of
      CKD's patient includes dietary phosphate restriction, the use of medicines, and
      parathyroidectomy. In the mainland of China, there are not certain useful medicines to treat
      sHPT, including the derivatives of vitamin D, calcimimetic agent, non calcium aluminum
      phosphate binders. Furthermore, medical therapy is not always successful in achieving
      adequate control of sHPT. Oral medications have efficacy limitations as well as
      side-effects. Otherwise, surgery treatment can only be used for the patients with enlarged
      parathyroid gland(s). The patients may suffer from the injury of operation,
      hypoparathyroidism, or recurrence of hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy.

      Then ultrasonic ablation may become a valuable alternative treatment that help control sHPT
      in selected patients presenting with enlarged parathyroid gland(s) visible at
      ultrasonography,.
