  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Dasatinib is effective and safe to give to
      people with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to determine the effects of the
      drug on LYN kinase activity in blood and bone marrow. Recent research shows that a key
      enzyme in CLL cells is responsible for cell survival. This enzyme is called LYN kinase.
      Laboratory studies show that inhibition of LYN kinase in CLL cells results in the death to
      CLL cells. Dasatinib has the ability to inhibit LYN kinase and, therefore, should have some
      effect on CLL cells.

      -  After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible and willing to
           participate in the research study, they will have the following tests and procedures.

        -  Dasatinib is given orally once daily. Each participant will have a pill diary to record
           doses and any missed doses. All necessary drug refills will be given during clinic
           appointments, at which time the pill diary and any unused study drug will be returned.

        -  During the first month of study treatment the participant will come to the clinic at
           the following intervals: Day 1: An EKG will be performed two hours after the first dose
           of medication; Days 3-8: Blood samples will be drawn once between days 3-8; Weeks 2-4:
           A physical examination, EKG and blood samples will be drawn once a week.

        -  Beginning with the second month of study treatment, participants will come to the
           clinic monthly for up to two years. The following tests and procedures will be done;
           physical examination (monthly), blood work (monthly), pregnancy test (monthly), EKG
           (monthly for 6 months, then when medically indicated), CT of the neck, chest and
           abdomen (every 2 months for 6 months, then once every 6 months), at the end of month 2,
           additional blood will be drawn for research testing.

        -  Participants can continue to take the study drug for up to two years as long as their
           disease does not progress and they are not experiencing any serious side effects.
