      The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between achieving symptomatic
      remission status by means of the 8 items of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),
      and personal and social functioning by means of the Personal and Social Performance (PSP)
      scale in participants treated with flexibly dosed paliperidone ER.

      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) and
      prospective (study following participants forward in time) 12-week study. Participants can
      be either in- or outpatients. The total study duration will be 12 weeks for each participant
      and will include following visits: Screening, Week 0, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment or
      early withdrawal). Throughout the study, participants will receive paliperidone ER in a
      flexible dosing range of 3 to 12 milligram per day (mg/day). Efficacy will primarily be
      evaluated by PANSS and PSP scale. Participants' safety will also be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self). The PANSS provides a total score and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items), each item scored on a scale of 1 (absent), 2 (minimal), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (moderately severe), 6 (severe) and 7 (extreme). The total score ranges from 30 to 210 and higher score indicates greater severity. Symptomatic remission was defined as achieving intensity level of mild or moderate on PANSS scale by all 8 items as the determinants for symptomatic remission: delusions, unusual thought content, hallucinatory behavior, conceptual disorganization, mannerisms/posturing, blunted affect, social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity.</description>

    <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Percentage of participants achieving improvement in PSP score by at least one category was reported.</description>

            <description>The SFS is a 36-item scale designed to assess social functioning in schizophrenia. It assesses abilities and performance in seven areas: social engagement, interpersonal communication, activities of daily living, recreation, social activities, competence at independent living, and occupation/employment. Total score ranges from 1 to 100 where higher score indicates a more favorable health state.</description>

        <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Percentage of participants achieving improvement in PSP score by at least one category was reported.</description>
