  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the pilot is to test the feasibility and utility of using a
      text-messaging system to engage adolescents in improved homework adherence during
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depressive disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent major depressive disorder leads to recurrent episodes, increased rates of
      attempted and completed suicides, and persistent social impairment between episodes
      (Weissman et al 1999). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an accepted first-line therapy
      for mild-moderate depression in adolescents. Integral to CBT is &quot;homework&quot; as it enhances
      mastery of newly learned coping strategies, facilitates generalization of skills to novel
      situations, increases self-efficacy, and ultimately reduces vulnerability to relapse
      (Detweiler et al 1999). Adherence to homework is a recognized problem in adults, and is
      similarly problematic in adolescents. One method of implementing CBT homework in a manner
      that is centric to current youth culture is through text messaging. By using a modern
      modality that many adolescents rely on for daily communication, there is the likelihood that
      they will find it more engaging than traditional modalities. Thus the potential that a text
      message system can help improve homework compliance in adolescents is significant, because
      improved homework adherence may ultimately be linked to improved clinical outcomes for these
      disorders with high rates of chronic morbidity and mortality.

          <title>Paper and Pen Homework</title>
          <description>Treatment as usual: therapy homework is completed by paper and pen.
Paper and pen homework: Homework will be standardized through the use of Judith Beck's dysfunctional thought record (DTR), which is a primary tool for patients to evaluate and respond in writing to their automatic thoughts (Beck 126). The homework will be done on a preprinted form which is assigned weekly and reviewed with their therapists at weekly sessions for 4 weeks.</description>

          <title>Text-message Homework</title>
          <description>Experimental treatment: therapy homework is completed by text messaging.
Text message system homework.: Homework will be standardized through the use of Judith Beck’s dysfunctional thought record (DTR), which is a primary tool for patients to evaluate and respond in writing to their automatic thoughts (Beck 126). The novel text-messaging system allows homework to be submitted directly through an adolescent’s cellular phone, includes text-messaged homework reminder prompts, and collates all homework for therapists to review with patients during therapy sessions. This is assigned and reviewed weekly for 4 weeks.</description>
