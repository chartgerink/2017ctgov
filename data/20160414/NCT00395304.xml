    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, serious illness among children in the United States. While a low dose of
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may effectively control symptoms, some children may require
      additional medications to maintain adequate asthma control. This study compares the
      effectiveness of a higher dose of ICS, ICS combined with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)
      medication, and ICS combined with a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) medication at
      reducing the impact and severity of asthma exacerbations that occur in children with mild to
      moderate persistent asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 9 million children in the United States have asthma, and it is a leading cause of
      hospitalizations and school absenteeism. Common asthma symptoms include wheezing, shortness
      of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. While there is no cure for asthma, most children
      who receive proper treatment are able to control symptoms and lead a normal life. Low doses
      of ICS are commonly prescribed to prevent symptoms and keep asthma under control. While this
      is usually sufficient to prevent asthma attacks, some children do not respond well to low
      dose ICS alone. For these children, their asthma symptoms may be more effectively controlled
      by either receiving a higher dose of ICS or receiving LABA or LTRA medications in
      combination with a low dose of ICS. Both LABA and LTRA medications are used to help control
      moderate to severe asthma. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a
      high dose of ICS versus a low dose of ICS plus either LABA or LTRA medication at improving
      asthma control and reducing the severity of symptoms that occur in children with mild to
      moderate persistent asthma.

      This study began with an 8-week screening period during which participants were monitored
      while they used an inhaler with a low dose of ICS medication. During this time, participants
      also attended one or two study visits. At each visit, participants underwent a physical
      examination, exhaled nitric oxide analysis, and lung function and airway pressure testing.
      After enrollment criteria were met, participants underwent these same evaluations again, and
      they completed questionnaires to assess asthma control, quality of life, and home
      environmental factors. Blood was collected and a methacholine challenge test was completed,
      which artificially triggers an asthma attack to determine the severity of an individual's
      asthma. Participants then were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences, each of
      which includes the following three regimens in a different order:

        -  Low dose of ICS and salmeterol, a LABA medication

        -  Low dose of ICS and montelukast, a LTRA medication

        -  Double dose of ICS

      Each treatment period lasted 16 weeks, with study visits occurring weekly. A physical
      examination, blood collection, lung function and airway pressure testing, a methacholine
      challenge test, and questionnaires occurred at selected visits. Throughout the study,
      participants recorded asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow rates, and rescue medication
      usage in a daily diary. The entire length of the study did not exceed 56 weeks.

    <description>One treatment period was ranked as better than another if the total amount of prednisone received during the period was at least 180 mg less, if the number of annualized asthma-control days during the final 12 weeks of the period was increased by at least 31 days, or if the FEV1 at the end of the period was at least 5% higher. If the prednisone threshold was met, then we ignored the number of asthmacontrol days and the FEV1. If the threshold for asthma-control days was met, then we ignored the FEV1. Otherwise, the order of response was determined by the FEV1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to perform reproducible spirometry according to American Thoracic Society (ATS)
             criteria

          -  History of asthma symptoms (e.g., cough, wheezing, shortness of breath) and meets at
             least one of the following criteria:

               1. Naïve to controller therapy and meeting National Asthma Education and Prevention
                  Program (NAEPP) criteria for mild-moderate persistent asthma (symptoms at least
                  2 days per week and/or night-time awakenings due to asthma at least 2 nights per
                  month)

               2. Current uncontrolled asthma (meets NAEPP criteria for mild-moderate persistent
                  asthma) while receiving an ICS dose greater than or equal to 200 ug per day of
                  fluticasone equivalent or some form of non-ICS controller therapy (e.g.,
                  montelukast, theophylline, cromolyn)

               3. Asthma is currently under control while receiving an ICS dose between 300 to 400
                  ug per day of fluticasone equivalent and willing to consider changing current
                  treatment to monotherapy with one dose of ICS (current standard of care)

               4. Asthma is currently under control while receiving some form of combination
                  therapy, such as ICS less than or equal to 200 ug per day of fluticasone
                  equivalent in addition to a non-ICS controller therapy (e.g., LABA, montelukast,
                  theophylline, cromolyn), and willing to consider changing current treatment to
                  monotherapy with one dose of ICS (current standard of care)

          -  FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% following bronchodilator administration (4 puffs)
             at study visit 1. Individuals will need to hold albuterol, montelukast, theophylline,
             ipratropium bromide (or other anticholinergics) and LABAs per study instructions
             prior to reversibility testing. If an individual is receiving these types of
             medications prior to study visit 1, he/she may be brought back to the clinical center
             within 1 week following appropriate medication withholding to attempt qualification
             by reversibility criteria. If the individual does not meet this requirement, they may
             qualify for enrollment if their PC20 methacholine FEV1 is less than or equal to 12.5
             mg/ml at the time of randomization. If FEV1 is less than 70%, thus precluding the
             methacholine challenge at this visit, then completion of the visit will be postponed
             several days and an additional attempt to obtain a methacholine challenge test will
             be made. If the methacholine challenge still cannot be performed, an individual may
             still qualify by reversibility criteria at this visit.

          -  History of clinical varicella or varicella vaccine; individuals needing the vaccine
             may receive it from their primary care physician prior to study entry

        <title>The Number of Participants With a Differential Response to the Three Step-up Therapies Based on Fixed Threshold Criteria for the Following Three Asthma Control Measures: Use of Oral Prednisone for Acute Asthma Exacerbations, Asthma Control Days and FEV1.</title>
        <description>One treatment period was ranked as better than another if the total amount of prednisone received during the period was at least 180 mg less, if the number of annualized asthma-control days during the final 12 weeks of the period was increased by at least 31 days, or if the FEV1 at the end of the period was at least 5% higher. If the prednisone threshold was met, then we ignored the number of asthmacontrol days and the FEV1. If the threshold for asthma-control days was met, then we ignored the FEV1. Otherwise, the order of response was determined by the FEV1.</description>
