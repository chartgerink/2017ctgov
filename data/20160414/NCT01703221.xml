  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of omarigliptin 25 mg weekly (as
      monotherapy) compared with sitagliptin 50 mg daily and placebo, and the long term safety (up
      to 52 weeks) of omarigliptin 25 mg weekly. The primary hypotheses are that after 24 weeks:
      1) Omarigliptin 25 mg weekly provides a greater reduction from baseline in glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) compared with placebo, and 2) The mean change from baseline in HbA1c in
      participants treated with omarigliptin 25 mg weekly is non-inferior compared with that in
      participants treated with sitagliptin 50 mg daily.

      The treatment period is composed of a 24-week double-blind period (Phase A) and a 28-week
      open-label period (Phase B). Participants will receive in Phase A: omarigliptin 25 mg once
      weekly, sitagliptin 50 mg once daily or placebo and in Phase B: omarigliptin 25 mg once
      weekly.

      <recruitment_details>Forty-eight sites in Japan received IRB approval and were shipped clinical supplies in this study and randomized at least one participant. One hundred and seventeen participants were not randomized; the most common reason for particpants not being randomized was screen failure.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In Phase A, participants were randomized to receive either omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly, sitagliptin 50 mg once daily or placebo for 24 weeks in a blinded manner. In Phase B, all participants received open-label omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly for 28 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>
