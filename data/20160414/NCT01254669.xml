  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, Black women are more likely to die of cervical cancer than White
      women. In developing countries and globally, Haitian immigrant women are more likely to die
      of cervical cancer than any other women in the world. Studies have shown a disparity in
      parental acceptance of the HPV vaccine with parents of Black adolescent girls being less
      likely to accept and comply with HPV immunization schedules than Whites. The objective of
      this study is to increase HPV immunization rates in Haitian and African American adolescent
      girls. The investigator's hypothesis is that a validated behavior change mechanism,
      brief-negotiating interviewing (BNI), will effectively increase the proportion of mothers
      who give consent for their daughters' HPV vaccine, which will ultimately lead to higher
      vaccination rates, and increase knowledge of HPV infection and the vaccine in Haitian
      immigrant and African American mothers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., Black women have higher rates of cervical cancer than White women. Women in
      Haiti and Haitian immigrant women have among the highest rates of cervical cancer in the
      world. The recent introduction of the HPV vaccine provides an opportunity to reduce the
      disparity in cervical cancer rates between White and Black non-White (Haitians and US born
      African-Americans (AA)). Unfortunately, females ages 11-14 have low rates, 25%, of HPV
      vaccination. For the vaccine to be effective it must be given prior to the onset of sexual
      activity. Parents are a central audience for interventions to promote HPV vaccine uptake in
      children &lt; 18 since parents have to consent.

      Hypothesis: The objective of this study is to increase HPV immunization rates in Haitian and
      African American adolescent girls. My hypothesis is that a validated behavior change
      mechanism, brief-negotiating interviewing (BNI), will effectively increase the proportion of
      mothers who give consent for their daughters' HPV vaccine, which will ultimately lead to
      higher vaccination rates, and increase knowledge of HPV infection and the vaccine in Haitian
      immigrant and African American mothers.

      Specific Aim 1a: Develop a script that will use BNI to address low-income Haitian immigrant
      and African American mothers' concern about HPV immunization

      Specific Aim 1b: Teach community health workers to use BNI to enhance HPV acceptability
      Specific aim 2: Conduct a pilot, randomized clinical trial to determine feasibility
      effectiveness of BNI, and to obtain empirical estimates of study parameters to assess
      logistical aspects of a larger RCT. This will include assessing recruitment and retention of
      subjects, intervention delivery, and effect size.

      Study design: The primary study design will be a RCT which will follow the CONSORT
      requirements for data reporting and analysis. One-hundred immigrant Haitian mothers bringing
      their adolescent daughters (age range 11 to 15) to clinic for routine care will be
      randomized to BNI (n=80) or to standard care (N=80) information about HPV vaccine). The
      primary outcome will be receipt of the first HPV vaccination in the adolescent within 1
      month of randomization. The secondary outcome will be maternal knowledge about HPV vaccine.
      This study will provide key estimates so that we can conduct a fully-powered RCT, which will
      include completion of the primary HPV series (3 vaccinations) as the primary outcome.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We recruited 100 English- and 100 Haitian Creole-speaking mothers of adolescent girls between April 2011 and September 2013 at the medical clinic ( pediatrics and adolescent clinic). Of 1,703 mothers approached during the study period,1,201 were ineligible. Of the 502 eligible, 302 declined and 200 (40%) were recruited &amp;consented to pilot trial.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following participant enrollment, but prior to group assignment, no significant event occurred. However, in our study after being randomized, participants provided demographic data. During data collection, one participants was excluded/self-withdrew from the trial for fear that demographic data may affect her immigration status/not documented.</pre_assignment_details>

Mothers assigned to the Control Group received the low-literacy, standard-practice, HPV vaccine information sheet usually given to all patients prior to vaccination. Control mothers met once with the research assistant to collect demographic characteristics, HPV knowledge, and vaccine status of the daughter on the day of visit. No BNI counseling was provided.</description>

Of the 100 women in the Control Group (n=50 Haitian, 50 African-American), three African-American mothers did not complete Control Group activities because they did not complete the survey. Reasons for initial dropout/decline to participate included being too busy, not interested, time constraints, and daughter not sexually active upon hearing study has to do with HPV vaccine.</description>
