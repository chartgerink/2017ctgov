  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare worker uniforms are frequently contaminated with bacteria known to cause
      infections in humans. These bacteria are acquired during the workday. A new technology of
      antimicrobial textiles have been developed and incorporated into the fabric of health care
      worker uniforms, reportedly with effectiveness rates of &gt; 99% but there is little literature
      describing the effectiveness of Healthcare worker (HCW) uniforms with antimicrobial
      properties in the clinical setting. Because of the potential benefit that such uniforms
      could offer HCWs and patients alike, further investigation into whether these fabrics are
      effective is warranted.

      Up to 140 physicians, nurses, and midlevel providers who work at Denver Health on the
      general internal medicine wards will be invited to participate in this study. Participants
      will be randomized to wear either uniforms (scrubs) that have antimicrobial properties or
      standard scrubs provided by the hospital. At the end of an 8-hour workday, three areas on
      each uniform and each subject's wrist area will be cultured to assess for total bacterial
      colonization as well as for various resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and resistant
      gram-negative rods.

      Primary Hypothesis: HCW uniforms with antimicrobial properties will have less bacterial
      contamination than standard uniforms (scrubs) at the end of an 8-hour workday.

      Specific aim 1a. Demonstrate that antimicrobial uniforms will have less total bacterial
      contamination of sites swabbed compared to standard uniform after an 8-hour workday.

      Specific aim 1b. Demonstrate that antimicrobial uniforms will have less
      antimicrobial-resistant bacterial contamination (specifically looking for MRSA, VRE, and
      resistant gram negatives) of sites swabbed compared to standard uniform after an 8-hour
      workday.
