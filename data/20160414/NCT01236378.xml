  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirolimus, 1 mg, white, triangular tablets (RapamuneÂ®) was approved on 03 April 2007 in
      China for prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplantation. A pharmacokinetic (PK)
      study to be conducted in renal allograft recipients was requested by State Food and Drug
      Administration (SFDA) to provide further guidance for clinical use.

      To minimize risk to patients, this study is designed to collect blood PK samples from renal
      allograft recipients who are currently under sirolimus (1 mg tablets) treatment with or
      without concomitant medication(s). PK samples will be collected from these patients to
      characterize the steady state PK of sirolimus during sirolimus maintenance therapy. This
      study will not involve any changes to the established treatment regimen for the patients who
      enroll in the study

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.</description>

    <description>Serum creatinine, an indicator of kidney function, formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue, is removed from blood by kidneys and excreted in urine. Increased creatinine in blood indicates decreased kidney function. Creatinine levels are age, gender and race dependent as they are related to an individual's muscle mass. Renal transplant recipients may have elevated serum creatinine. For this study an abnormal serum creatinine level is defined as 1.3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory where the determination was performed.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>GFR, an index of kidney function, describes flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. GFR was calculated using the Simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Dysfunction (MDRD) GFR equation. Normal GFR is &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m^2; children and older people usually have lower GFR. Often, kidney transplant recipients do not have normal GFRs. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 is consistent with kidney failure. For this posting, the number of subjects with a GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 is listed.</description>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling.

        <title>Number of Participants With Serum Creatinine Levels More Than (&gt;) 1.3 Times the Upper Limit of Normal</title>
        <description>Serum creatinine, an indicator of kidney function, formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue, is removed from blood by kidneys and excreted in urine. Increased creatinine in blood indicates decreased kidney function. Creatinine levels are age, gender and race dependent as they are related to an individualâs muscle mass. Renal transplant recipients may have elevated serum creatinine. For this study an abnormal serum creatinine level is defined as 1.3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory where the determination was performed.</description>

        <description>GFR, an index of kidney function, describes flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. GFR was calculated using the Simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Dysfunction (MDRD) GFR equation. Normal GFR is &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m^2; children and older people usually have lower GFR. Often, kidney transplant recipients do not have normal GFRs. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 is consistent with kidney failure. For this posting, the number of subjects with a GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 is listed.</description>
