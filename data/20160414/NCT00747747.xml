  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to demonstrate that SINUclean DM® spray, added to the standard
      (amoxicillin/clavulanate) therapy of the acute episode of sinusitis (acute, subacute or
      chronic), is safe ad capable to determine the resolution of the symptoms in a shorter time
      in comparison with the standard therapy without co-adjuvant, or with simple saline lavage.

      The randomized subject with diagnosis of acute episode of sinusitis with symptoms and mucus
      in the paranasal sinuses, will treat his/her condition with background
      amoxicillin/clavulanate and with inhalation of Sinuclean or Saline, while the control group
      will not use any spray for symptom relief. Anti-histaminic, steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs are forbidden. The patient is requested to evaluate his state of symptoms by recording
      in a diary

        -  the pain or feeling of facial oppression;

        -  nasal dripping anterior or posterior;

        -  nasal congestion. SCALE 0 = no symptom

             1. = mild symptom: clearly perceptible, but easily tolerated

             2. = moderate symptom: clear awareness of the symptom, that is annoying but tolerable

             3. = severe: symptom very annoying, difficult to tolerate, interfering with the
                ordinary life Four measures per day (2 for administration of the therapy -
                before/after) of which the median will be used; plus an evening measure
                &quot;retrospective&quot; of the past 12 hours.

      If possible it will be assessed the status of paranasal sinuses before and after the
      treatment with a CT scan.

      The treatment intervals is the week. After baseline and start of treatment, are planned two
      control visit. The subject will complete the study at the first control visit without
      symptoms. After the second visit, if the symptoms are still present, the subject will
      complete as a &quot;treatment-failure&quot;.
