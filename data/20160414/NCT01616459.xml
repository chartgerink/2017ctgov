  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two
      formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine (2830929A and 2830930A) administered
      as 3-dose primary vaccination during the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose
      in the second year of life. To comply with the routine infant immunisation program, the
      licensed GSK Biologicals DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa) vaccine will be co-administered in
      infants with the pneumococcal study vaccines.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity of the two formulations of GSK
      Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2830929A (11-valent vaccine or 11Pn vaccine) and 2830930A
      (12-valent vaccine or 12Pn vaccine), when administered as 3-dose primary vaccination during
      the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose in the second year of life, when
      compared to immune responses to the licensed vaccines Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™, and to
      assess the reactogenicity and safety of these two same investigational formulations when
      administered according to this schedule. To comply with the routine infant immunisation
      program, the licensed GSK Biologicals DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa™) vaccine will be
      co-administered in infants with the pneumococcal study vaccines.

    <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine/cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -3, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration higher than or equal to (≥) 0.05 µg/mL. Primary outcome results correspond to antibody concentrations for all serotypes presented at the exception of those for the antibodies against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype 3 (ANTI-3). Analysis of concentrations of antibodies against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype 6C (ANTI-6C) was not performed due to unavailability of a specific qualified assay.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Study vaccines were administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination in healthy infants between 6-12 weeks (42-90 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination (Primary Phase), and then as an additional booster dose when subjects reached 12-15 months of age (Booster Phase).</pre_assignment_details>

The 3 first doses of 11Pn vaccine were administered intramuscularly into the right anterolateral thigh and Infanrix hexa™ was administered intramuscularly into the left anterolateral thigh. The booster dose of 11Pn vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right deltoid (or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate) and that of Infanrix hexa™ was administered intramuscularly into the left deltoid (or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate).</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes During the Primary Phase of the Study.</title>
        <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine/cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -3, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration higher than or equal to (≥) 0.05 µg/mL. Primary outcome results correspond to antibody concentrations for all serotypes presented at the exception of those for the antibodies against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype 3 (ANTI-3). Analysis of concentrations of antibodies against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype 6C (ANTI-6C) was not performed due to unavailability of a specific qualified assay.</description>
        <time_frame>At study Month 3, e. g. at one month post-Dose 3 of pneumococcal vaccine</time_frame>
        <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity of the Primary Phase which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning primary immunogenicity outcome measures were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component after primary vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.</population>

        <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine/cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -3, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration higher than or equal to (≥) 0.05 µg/mL. Analysis of concentrations of antibodies against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype 6C (ANTI-6C) will not be performed due to unavailability of a specific qualified assay.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited General Symptoms and With Solicited General Symptoms With Relationship to Vaccination, During the Primary Phase of the Study</title>
        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were Drowsiness, Irritability/Fussiness (Irr./Fuss.), Loss of appetite (Loss Appet.) and Fever (rectal temperature higher than [≥] 38.0 degrees Celsius [°C]),. Any = Occurrence of the specified solicited general symptom, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Related = Occurrence of the specified symptom assessed by the investigators as causally related to vaccination. Grade 3 Drowsiness = Drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Irr./Fuss. = Crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Loss of appetite = Subject did not eat at all. Grade 3 Fever = Rectal temperature higher than (&gt;) 40.0°C.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort for the Primary Phase, which included all subjects who received at least one of the 3 vaccine doses priming against pneumococcal diseases, with analysis done solely on subjects for whom post-vaccination results about solicited symptoms were available.</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited General Symptoms and With Solicited General Symptoms With Relationship to Vaccination, During the Booster Phase of the Study</title>
        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were Drowsiness, Irritability/Fussiness (Irr./Fuss.), Loss of appetite (Loss Appet.) and Fever (rectal temperature higher than [≥] 38.0 degrees Celsius [°C]). Any = Occurrence of the specified solicited general symptom, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Related = Occurrence of the specified symptom assessed by the investigators as causally related to vaccination. Grade 3 Drowsiness = Drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Irr./Fuss. = Crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Loss of appetite = Subject did not eat at all. Grade 3 Fever = Rectal temperature higher than (&gt;) 40.0°C.</description>

        <description>An unsolicited AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For the marketed products administered in the study, this also included failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse of the product. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination.</description>
