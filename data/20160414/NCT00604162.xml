      To see if PillCam COLON will demonstrate diagnostic yield &gt;80% in detecting significant
      colonic pathologies when compared to colonoscopy in the target population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development and introduction of a specially designed, customized colon capsule combined
      with a dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol will allow for more efficient
      evaluation of the colonic mucosa. This is expected to improve the capability of the Given®
      Diagnostic System to detect colonic pathologies and to serve as a diagnostic and screening
      tool for colonic disease.

      This study is designed to compare capsule colonoscopy and colonoscopy procedures in
      detecting colon abnormalities. Note that the physician performing the capsule endoscopy and
      reading the capsule videos and the physician performing the colonoscopy were unaware of each
      other's findings until completion of the examinations and reports (assessor-blind).

    <description>The number of participants that completed the capsule endoscopy procedure with video images of the entire colon that could be read by a clinician, or subsequently had a full colonoscopy with visualization by a different clinician.

    <description>Since the standard colonoscopy is the &quot;gold standard&quot; to which the PillCam is to be compared, the number of participants with the indicated lesions identified by a trained clinician using standard colonoscopy procedures is reported here. Note that some Participants had multiple lesions and so could be included in more than one size category. Advanced adenoma is defined as 1) an adenoma 1 cm or larger or 2) an adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia. All colorectal cancers were 6mm or larger.</description>

    <description>Readings of videos from the PillCam COLON were performed by trained physicians who identified lesions (types and sizes). Sensitivity was calculated as the percentage of participants who had positive findings on capsule endoscopy (of a specified category) among those participants who had positive findings on colonoscopy of the same category (reported in Outcome Measure 1). The false negative rate is equal to 1 - sensitivity and indicated the percentage of lesions missed by capsule endoscopy.</description>

    <description>Readings of videos from the PillCam COLON were performed by trained physicians who identified lesions (types and sizes). Specificity was calculated as the percentage of participants who had negative findings on capsule endoscopy (of a specified category) among participants with negative colonoscopy findings of the same category (reported in Outcome Measure 1). This corresponds to 1 - the false positive rate.</description>

    <description>The PillCam COLON capsule is an ingestible capsule equipped with an endoscope that has two imagers, enabling it to acquire video images from both ends. the device measures 31 by 11 mm and acquires images at a rate of 4 frames per second. Recording and downloading of data are similar those of the data for small-bowel capsule endoscopy.</description>

            <title>Specificity of Capsule Endoscopy for Indicated Lesions</title>
            <description>Readings of videos from the PillCam COLON were performed by trained physicians who identified lesions (types and sizes). Specificity was calculated as the percentage of participants who had negative findings on capsule endoscopy (of a specified category) among participants with negative colonoscopy findings of the same category (reported in Outcome Measure 1). This corresponds to 1 - the false positive rate.</description>
