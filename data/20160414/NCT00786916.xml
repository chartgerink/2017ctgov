  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial intended to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of lidocaine at reducing pain associated wiht propofol infusion for short-term
      deep sedation in children. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo (saline) or
      one of two dosing regimens of IV lidocaine prior to initiating propofol infusion. The
      efficacy of the differing lidocaine doses will be compared to determine the minimum dose
      required to safely achieve alleviation of pain. We hypothesize that premedicating with
      lidocaine will significantly decrease pain experienced by pediatric patients receiving
      propofol for outpatient sedation.

            <title>Maximal Pain/Discomfort</title>
            <description>FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) Pain assessment scale was administered by a trained observer. The patient's parent documented maximum distress using a 100-mm visual analog scale where &quot;0&quot; represented &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 (the furthest point to the left) represented the worst pain ever.</description>
