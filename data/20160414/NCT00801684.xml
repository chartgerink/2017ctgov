  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of single
      doses of trospium inhalation powder (TrIP) administered to subjects with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD).

    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study.
      Following screening, each eligible subject was randomized to a dosing sequence. Study
      subjects received a total of 5 single doses, each separated by a 3- to 14-day washout
      period. Doses A, B, C, and D were administered in a double-blind fashion, in sequences
      generated by a 4-period Latin square design. The 4 dosing sequences were: ABCD, BDAC, CADB,
      and DCBA. Dose E was administered in an open-label fashion as the final dose in each dosing
      sequence for all subjects.

      Subjects reported to the clinic the evening prior to each dose. Protocol assessments were
      carried out until 24 hours postdose. Pulmonary function testing (via spirometry) was
      captured at specified timepoints at baseline as well as before and after dosing. Other
      efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed according to protocol. Blood sampling was
      performed for assessment of trospium concentrations at specified timepoints.

    <description>Following screening, each subject was randomized to a sequence of 5 dosing periods (Doses A, B, C, D, and E). Each period was separated by a 3- to 14-day washout interval.
The dosing formulations were as follows:
Dose A = placebo Dose B = TrIP-2D (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and DPPC) Dose C = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and sodium saccharin) Dose D = TrIP-2D (400 μg TrCl) Dose E = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl) + Foradil (12 μg formoterol fumarate) FEV1 (L)was measured at 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postdose.</description>

            <description>Following screening, each subject was randomized to a sequence of 5 dosing periods (Doses A, B, C, D, and E). Each period was separated by a 3- to 14-day washout interval.
The dosing formulations were as follows:
Dose A = placebo Dose B = TrIP-2D (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and DPPC) Dose C = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and sodium saccharin) Dose D = TrIP-2D (400 μg TrCl) Dose E = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl) + Foradil (12 μg formoterol fumarate) FEV1 (L)was measured at 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postdose.</description>
