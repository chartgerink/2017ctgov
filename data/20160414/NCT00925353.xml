  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that one-time application of 4%
      lidocaine gel (TOPICAINE) on the skin of the breasts and chest wall as recommended for
      pre-medication to reduce discomfort during screening mammography does not result in adverse
      effects, electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, or systemically toxic plasma concentration of
      lidocaine or its principal metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX).

    <description>Plasma concentration of lidocaine and MEGX in nanograms/milliliter were measured prior to one-time application of 4% lidocaine gel on the skin of the breasts and chest wall as recommended for use as as pre-medication to reduce discomfort during screening mammography, and at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours. Due to the high frequency of nondetectable values, pharmacokinetic parameters could not be estimated. Measurements at all time points were grouped together to select a median.</description>
