  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 to 5 months of three treatments ―
      omalizumab, corticosteroid therapy boost, and placebo ― in reducing fall exacerbations in
      inner-city children and adolescents with allergic persistent asthma when initiated
      approximately 4 -6 weeks prior to the start of the first day of each participant's school
      year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the increase in the prevalence of asthma has abated, levels of asthma morbidity and
      mortality remain near record highs. An asthma exacerbation is a major factor contributing to
      morbidity, and even mortality in patients with asthma. Although current approaches to
      treatment have reduced these risks, asthma exacerbations are major problems for inner-city
      patients and their families, and prevention of these events continues to be a significant
      challenge. In children with asthma, there are predictable seasonal epidemics of
      exacerbations, especially during the fall season, otherwise known as the &quot;September
      epidemic.&quot;

    <description>Asthma exacerbation defined as a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the first day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome.

        <description>Outcome measure description: The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a validated tool to assess asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients &gt;= 12 yrs old. It is comprised of 5 questions assessing symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (higher score indicating better control). Total scores can range from 5-25. A score of &lt;= 19 is indicative of not well-controlled asthma. The minimally important difference is 3 points.</description>

It is comprised of 5 questions assessing symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (higher score indicating better control). Total scores can range from 5-25. A score of &lt;= 19 is indicative of not well-controlled asthma.

            <title>Asthma Control Test Score: Child Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), Treatment Steps 2-4 (Omalizumab vs. ICS)</title>
            <description>The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients ages 4 to 11 years. Scores can range from 0 to 27. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference in C-ACT scores is not defined.</description>
