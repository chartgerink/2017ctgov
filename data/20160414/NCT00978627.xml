  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania, and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart
      (IDegAsp)) with insulin detemir (IDet) plus insulin aspart in patients with type 1 diabetes
      (main period) followed by the extension period comparing the long-term safety of NN5401 plus
      insulin aspart with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart.

      The main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN5401-3594 while the extension
      period is registered as NN5401-3645.

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 79 sites in 9 countries: Denmark (3 sites), Poland (6 sites), Romania (8 sites), France (3 sites), United Kingdom (8 sites), Russian Federation (11 sites), Israel (4 sites), Australia (7 sites), and United States (29 sites). Some sites did not enrol subjects in the extension period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The total duration of treatment was up to 52 weeks (26 weeks [main trial: NN5401-3594, NCT00978627] + 26 weeks [extension trial: NN5401-3645]), separated by 1 week of wash-out period; during which subjects were treated with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin twice daily (BID) in combination with insulin aspart.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>

        <description>Corresponds to rate of AEs per 100 patient years of exposure. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
