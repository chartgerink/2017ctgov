  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 neoadjuvant treatment regimens
      in female patients with locally advanced, inflammatory or early stage HER2 positive breast
      cancer. Before surgery, patients will be randomized to one of 4 treatment arms, to receive 4
      cycles of a)Herceptin + docetaxel b)Herceptin + docetaxel + pertuzumab c)Herceptin +
      pertuzumab or 4)pertuzumab + docetaxel. Pertuzumab will be administered at a loading dose of
      840mg iv, then 420mg iv 3-weekly, Herceptin at a loading dose of 8mg/kg iv then 6mg/kg
      3-weekly, and docetaxel at a dose of 75mg/m2 escalating to 100mg/m2 3-weekly. During the
      entire pre- and post-surgery period all patients will receive adequate chemotherapy as per
      standard of care, as well as any surgery and/or radiotherapy as required. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

Adjuvant (2-Week Post-Operative) Treatment: Participants received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (Cycles 5−7). Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was continued every 3 weeks from Cycle 8 to Cycle 21.</description>

        <description>Tumor assessments were made based upon the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria - version 1.0. The clinical response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for primary breast tumor using the following algorithm: CR: if measurement of ‘0’ is noted at a given cycle as compared to baseline measurement which is greater than (&gt;)0 at screening or cycle 1 Day 1; PR: if measurement is at least a 30 percent (%) decreased compared to baseline levels . (Reference= baseline size or sum of sizes); SD: if measurement at a given cycle is not sufficient shrinkage to qualify for neither PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to baseline levels. PD: if lesion is at least a 20 % increase from measurements at baseline.</description>

            <description>Clinical response was determined based on tumor measurements by sponsor in combination with tumor response assessment by investigator. Tumor assessments were made based on the RECIST criteria - version 1.0 The clinical response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for: i) the primary breast lesion; (ii) across secondary breast lesions, (iii) across all breast lesions (iv) across axillary nodes (v) across supraclavicular nodes and (vi) across all nodes (vii) across all lesions (overall) using the following algorithm: CR: if measurement of ‘0’ is noted at a given cycle as compared to baseline measurement which is &gt;0 at screening or cycle 1 day 1; PR: if measurement is at least a 30% decreased compared to baseline levels . (Reference= baseline size or sum of sizes). Clinical Responders are participants who have achieved CR or PR during the Neo-adjuvant treatment. Overall response is derived based on the sum total of breast tumors and all nodes examined.</description>

            <description>Tumor assessments were made based upon the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria - version 1.0. The clinical response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for: i) the primary breast lesion; (ii) across secondary breast lesions, (iii) across all breast lesions (iv) across axillary nodes (v) across supraclavicular nodes and (vi) across all nodes (vii) across all lesions (overall) using the following algorithm: PD: if lesion is at least a 20 % increased from measurements at baseline. Percentage of participants along with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for one sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method were reported. Missing investigator assessments were considered as no progressive disease.</description>

            <description>DFS was defined as the time from the first date of no disease (date of surgery) to the first documentation of PD or death. Participants without progression after surgery were considered Disease Free. Any evidence of contralateral disease in-situ was not considered as PD. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documentation of PD or death. Any evidence of contralateral disease in-situ was not considered as PD. DFS and PFS were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
