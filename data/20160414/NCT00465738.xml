  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the
      treatment of arm tightness (upper limb spasticity) using two different dilutions of
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free of complexing
      proteins. Injected into a muscle, incobotulinumtoxinA causes a reversible local weakening of
      the muscle for several months, and may improve an impaired muscle function by lessening the
      muscle tightness within few days. IncobotulinumtoxinA is widely used for various severe
      neurological conditions. There is some evidence that the treatment effect may be influenced
      by the amount of the solvent in which incobotulinumtoxinA is diluted before injection.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the number of responder at Week 4; response defined as an improvement (reduction) of at least one point in the DAS for the primary therapeutic target from baseline visit to Week 4. The DAS determines the functional impairment for the domains hygiene, dressing, limb position and pain according to the following scale: 0 = no disability; 1 = mild disability; 2 = moderate disability; 3 = severe disability. At Screening visit, the subject and investigator, selected together one of the four domains as the primary therapeutic target.</description>

    <description>Response is defined as an improvement (increase) of at least one point in the Barthel Index from baseline visit. The Barthel Index was assessed for the items feeding, grooming, toilet use, bathing and dressing. Feeding: 0 = unable; 1 = needs help cutting, spreading butter etc.; 2 = independent; Grooming: 0 = needs help with personal care; 1 = independent face/hair/teeth/shaving; Toilet use: 1 = need some help, but could do something alone; 2 = independent; Bathing: 0 = dependent; 1 = independent; Dressing: 0 = dependent; 1 = needs help but could do about half unaided; 2 = independent.</description>

      <recruitment_details>216 female and male subjects with upper limb spasticity caused by either stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy were screened starting February 2007. Recruitment advertisements according to local law and approved by the responsible IEC were published as needed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The protocol contained a screening period of 7 days to allow evaluation of laboratory and ECGs in order to determine eligibility. 24 subjects were screening failures due to violation of selection or protocol criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the number of responder at Week 4; response defined as an improvement (reduction) of at least one point in the DAS for the primary therapeutic target from baseline visit to Week 4. The DAS determines the functional impairment for the domains hygiene, dressing, limb position and pain according to the following scale: 0 = no disability; 1 = mild disability; 2 = moderate disability; 3 = severe disability. At Screening visit, the subject and investigator, selected together one of the four domains as the primary therapeutic target.</description>

            <title>Responder in FAT at Follow up - Full Analysis Set</title>
            <description>Response is defined as an improvement (increase) of at least one point in the FAT from baseline visit. For the FAT the investigator assessed the extent of functionality of the upper limb according to five standardized tests. Each test is rated with 0 = failed or 1 = successfully passed. For the evaluation, the sum of all test scores was calculated resulting in a total score from 0 to 5.</description>

        <description>Response is defined as an improvement of at least one point in the Ashworth Scale for the treated muscle group from baseline visit. The Ashworth Scale is a 5-point-scale to rate to degree of spasticity: 0 = No increase in tone; 1 = Slight increase in tone giving a “catch” when the limb was moved in flexion or extension; 2 = More marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed; 3 = Considerable increase in tone - passive movements difficult; 4 = Limb rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Passive Range of Motion (PROM) - Wrist Extension</title>
        <description>For the PROM all motions of wrist and elbow were measured from a defined neutral starting point position. The degrees of motion were added in the direction the wrist and elbow moved from the neutral starting position. The neutral starting position was the position of an upright standing/sitting person. The angle of the motion from the neutral starting position was measured in degrees using a goniometer. Angles were measured for the wrist with maximal dorsal extension, neutral position and maximal palmar flexion, and for the elbow with maximal extension, neutral position and maximal flexion.</description>

            <description>For the PROM all motions of wrist and elbow were measured from a defined neutral starting point position. The degrees of motion were added in the direction the wrist and elbow moved from the neutral starting position. The neutral starting position was the position of an upright standing/sitting person. The angle of the motion from the neutral starting position was measured in degrees using a goniometer. Angles were measured for the wrist with maximal dorsal extension, neutral position and maximal palmar flexion, and for the elbow with maximal extension, neutral position and maximal flexion.</description>
