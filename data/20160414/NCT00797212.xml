  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of the blood glucose monitoring
      system when used with samples taken from the palm and forearm for alternative site testing
      (AST).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The blood glucose monitoring system may be used for alternative site testing. The blood
      glucose results obtained by subjects with samples taken from the palm and forearm were
      compared with fingerstick capillary blood glucose results obtained from subjects by an HCP.
      Product labeling was evaluated for comprehension of performing alternative site testing as
      well as for additional meter features. User feedback about the system and its features was
      obtained.
