    <description>Percentage of participants who at 2 years from the start of treatment remained free from documented disease progression, relapse, or death.

    <description>CR: complete disappearance of all symptoms/objective signs of disease (enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) for at least 3 months following definitive re-evaluation at end of therapy. For initial bone marrow involvement, clearance of bone marrow documented by biopsy, normalization of blood counts with granulocytes greater than (&gt;)1,500 per microliter (/µL), hemoglobin &gt;12 grams per deciliter (g/dL), platelets &gt;100,000/µL. CRu: disappearance of all symptoms and nearly all measurable lesions, but persistence of some radiologic abnormalities with normalization of all biologic abnormalities; normalization of the performance status for at least 3 months after the definite evaluation of therapy. PR: at least 50 percent (%) reduction of measurable and evaluable lymphoma involvement for at least 4 weeks without occurrence of new manifestations, normalization of blood counts.

Participants without relapse were censored at their last assessment date. Participants who died due to tumour burden were considered in relapse. Participants who died due to any other causes were censored as of the death date. The reported data refer to values up to 40 months.</description>
