            <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer below 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The vaccine strains included A/Christchurch/16/2010 ( H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria) and B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/2009 (Yamagata) antigens.</description>
