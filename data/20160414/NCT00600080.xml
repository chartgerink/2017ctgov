  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the clinical performance of a recently improved daily
      disposable contact lens to an established daily disposable contact lens that contains a
      wetting agent.

    <description>Measured using high contrast and low contrast vision charts without the use of spectacles (glasses) or refraction equipment (for contact lens wearers). Values are on the logMar scale where lower values (&lt; 0) refer to 'better' values of sight. These scores are converted from a Snellen eye chart examination.</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to rate lens performance on a scale of 0 to 100 point scale (0= &quot;Extremely poor&quot; or &quot;Cannot use lenses&quot; and 100= &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Highly impressed with these lenses overall&quot;). The average score is reported. A factor analysis was used to identify the questions pertaining to product performance, a factor loading of 0.4 or greater was used.</description>

    <description>Number of subjects that measured as an optimum fit. Lens fit will be assessed using the following evaluations: horizontal and vertical centration, corneal coverage and movement. Normally, for an acceptable fit, centration and movement will fall within currently accepted clinical criteria [between -1 and +1 on a -2 to +2 grading scale.</description>

             oedema, corneal vascularisation, corneal staining, tarsal conjunctival changes or any
             other abnormality which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

        <description>Number of subjects that measured as an optimum fit. Lens fit will be assessed using the following evaluations: horizontal and vertical centration, corneal coverage and movement. Normally, for an acceptable fit, centration and movement will fall within currently accepted clinical criteria [between -1 and +1 on a -2 to +2 grading scale.</description>
