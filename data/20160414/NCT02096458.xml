  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the in-vivo disintegration time of a single
      dexlansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating (OD) tablet.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. An orally disintegrating (OD)
      form of dexlansoprazole is being tested to look at the average time that it takes for one
      tablet to disintegrate in the mouth of healthy volunteers. At the point at which the
      panelist would normally swallow the granules, they will record the time and expectorate the
      disintegrated tablet mass and not actually swallow the tablet or granules.

      The study will enroll approximately 8 healthy volunteers. All participants will take one
      dexlansoprazole 30 mg OD tablet on up to three separate study days. No more than 60 mg of
      dexlansoprazole will be tested in any one day.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 2 weeks. Participants will make up to 4 visits to
      the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone approximately 1 week after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The male or female sensory panelist is between 25 and 80 years of age (inclusive),
             healthy volunteers for study participation, and is able to read, understand, and sign
             and date a written informed consent form (ICF) and any required privacy authorization
             before study participation.

          2. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and
             complying with protocol requirements.

          3. The sensory panelist is qualified based on documented training and experience: All
             panelists will be provided by Senopsys, LLC: Panelists have been trained to detect,
             identify, recognize, and accurately describe different taste elements and flavor
             combinations and to measure oral disintegration times. Training is initially
             accomplished by tasting model compounds and learning to recognize and describe these
             accurately. These abilities are then honed and refined through additional experience
             in performing product testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator or the sensory
             panelist's general practitioner, might confound the results of the study or pose an
             additional risk in administering study drug(s) to the sensory panelist. This may
             include but is not limited to: a history of relevant drug or food allergies; history
             of cardiovascular or central nervous system disease; history or presence of
             clinically significant pathology; recent history of disease involving head, neck,
             esophagus (especially malignancy, radiation therapy, fungal infection where taste
             perception can be altered) or history of mental disease.

          2. If female, the sensory panelist is pregnant, nursing, planning to become pregnant
             during the study.

          3. Has a known hypersensitivity to dexlansoprazole or any component of dexlansoprazole
             delayed-release orally disintegrating (OD) tablet or proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
             (including lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or esomeprazole).

          4. Is currently taking any contraindicated medications.
