  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among those with type I diabetes, adolescents can be among the worst at achieving glycemic
      control. Behaviors normal in adolescent development (e.g., developing independence,
      rejecting parental norms in favor of peers) can be at odds with the demands of effective
      diabetes self-management. Modifying the family and patient interaction should be a crucial
      component to improving the ability of an adolescent to manage his or her diabetes.

      Mobile technology is becoming more popular in medicine, and adolescents, as a group are more
      inclined to accept technology as an adjunct to care. Mobile technology that links
      adolescents to health providers could help them to work through complex information that
      must be processed to make good decisions. Since this &quot;assistance&quot; comes from health
      professionals, it should help relax parents somewhat, thus reducing problems associated with
      parental hypervigilance and manipulation of the regimen to avoid problems of hypoglycemia.
      Parental-child conflicts may therefore be reduced by using cell phone glucose monitoring
      technology that directly reports self-blood glucose monitoring data to providers and creates
      a communication link to discuss therapeutic options.

      This study investigates whether the use of mobile technology, in the form of a cell phone
      glucose monitoring system, will help reduce the need for parents to assert behavioral
      control, which can negatively impact adolescent diabetes self-management. The study will
      also determine whether adolescents report improved quality of life, demonstrate competence
      in diabetes management, and are able to achieve better control of their diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Among patients with type I diabetes, adolescents struggle the most with self-management,
      which often results in poor glycemic control. Optimizing parent-patient interaction is
      crucial to improving self-management. Mobile technology with integrated glucose monitoring
      capability that links adolescents to providers may reduce parental hypervigilance and assist
      them to better understand self-management. .

      This study will investigate a novel cell phone glucose monitoring system (CPGM) with the
      following specific aims:

        1. To establish feasibility of a CPGM system as a component of an adolescent diabetes
           management program.

        2. To determine if the technology will improve a) quality of parent-child relationship, b)
           patient quality of life, c) competence in diabetes management, and d) metabolic
           control.

        3. To gather preliminary data for development of future intervention studies.

      120 adolescents with type I diabetes will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or
      control group. Experimental subjects will use the CPGM which will transmit all blood glucose
      data to a host computer. A nurse practitioner in the pediatric endocrinology clinic will
      determine need for telephone contacts based on evaluation of transmitted data. Subjects
      might be telephoned to discuss possible regimen adjustments, need for clinic visits, or
      referrals to additional services. Subjects will also be able to initiate contact with the
      project nurse. Control subjects will continue to receive standard care. .

      This study will assess the effect of the intervention in the four primary domains stated in
      the specific aims. These domains will be measured at baseline, three months, and six months.

    <description>The Cornell Parent Behavior Description Scale was used to measure the antecedents and consequences of children's perceptions of the behavior of their parents towards them. Each of 14 subscales is scored from 0-10. The potential range of the total score is therefore 0 (fewest behaviors) to 140 (most behaviors). We used the total score, which is equivalent to the sums of the subscales, and calculated the change from baseline to 6 months. The range of the change is given as a 95% CI. A change of zero would indicate no change. A positive number is a worsening , and a negative number indicates an improvement.</description>

            <description>The Cornell Parent Behavior Description Scale was used to measure the antecedents and consequences of children’s perceptions of the behavior of their parents towards them. Each of 14 subscales is scored from 0-10. The potential range of the total score is therefore 0 (fewest behaviors) to 140 (most behaviors). We used the total score, which is equivalent to the sums of the subscales, and calculated the change from baseline to 6 months. The range of the change is given as a 95% CI. A change of zero would indicate no change. A positive number is a worsening , and a negative number indicates an improvement.</description>
