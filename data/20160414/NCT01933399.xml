  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to discern if the use of a lumbosacral orthesis (LSO, also call a
      back support) improves the short-term outcome of lower back pain. participants will receive
      standard care (physical therapy, physician treatment), with one group also receiving an
      extensible LSO, and another group receiving an inextensible LSO. The inextensible LSO has
      been shown to increase stiffness of the trunk in individuals while wearing it. The
      hypothesis is that the group wearing the inextensible LSO will have improved outcomes over
      the other two groups (standard care or standard care plus the extensible LSO).

    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change score from baseline and the score at the second week. The Oswestry Disabilty Index is a 100 point self-assessment of disabilty due to lower back pain or complications from lower back pain. A score of 40 or more points is interpreted as signficant disability due to lower back pain. A score between 20 and 40 respresents disability, but the individual is still able to function to some degree with activities of daily living, but has to modify their behavior. A score less than 20 implies that the disabilty due to the lower back pain is not greatly impacting a wide range of functions. Compare score change to the minimal clinically important difference between the baseline and the 2nd week score, and the difference in the change scores across the 3 groups.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change score from baseline and the score at the second week. Compare score change to the minimal clinically important difference and analyze for statistical significance between the baseline and the 2nd week score, and the statistical difference in the change scores across the 3 groups. Scores from 0 to 10 with a higher score representing higher function and a lower score representing a decrease function.</description>

        <title>Change Score in the Self-assessment of Disability as Measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</title>
        <description>Change score from baseline and the score at the second week. The Oswestry Disabilty Index is a 100 point self-assessment of disabilty due to lower back pain or complications from lower back pain. A score of 40 or more points is interpreted as signficant disability due to lower back pain. A score between 20 and 40 respresents disability, but the individual is still able to function to some degree with activities of daily living, but has to modify their behavior. A score less than 20 implies that the disabilty due to the lower back pain is not greatly impacting a wide range of functions. Compare score change to the minimal clinically important difference between the baseline and the 2nd week score, and the difference in the change scores across the 3 groups.</description>
