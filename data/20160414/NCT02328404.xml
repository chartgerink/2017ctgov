      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation
      on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome prognosis.

      A randomized, double-blind, Parallel design comparing vitamin D with Placebo will be
      conducted on 60 overweight females diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria and
      have serum 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/ml. The results are expected to assess the improvement of
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome prognosis and the effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Chromium
      Serum Levels and Insulin Resistance.

      controlled randomised double blind study to examine the Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation
      on Chromium Serum Levels and Insulin Resistance among Overweight Jordanian Women with
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Irbid. comparing vitamin D with Placebo will be conducted on 60
      overweight females diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria and have serum
      25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/ml. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the dose regimen considered in
      this study as the product SmPC which will be measured through the assessment of serum 25
      (OH)D along the trial period. the expected duration of participants participation will be
      around 104 days divided on 6 visits. the first visit will be 7 days before the beginning of
      the study, the second will be at day 0 of the trial to measure the baseline, third vist at
      day 30, then at day 60, then at day 90 and the final visit will be after 104 days of study.
      The results are expected to assess the improvement of PCOS prognosis and the effect of
      Vitamin D Supplementation on Chromium Serum Levels and Insulin Resistance.
