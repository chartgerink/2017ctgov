      This is a multicenter, open-label, single arm trial to evaluate the time to eugonadal
      testosterone range after initial testosterone gel 2% application, time to steady state after
      after initiation of testosterone gel 2%, and drying time after application of testosterone
      gel 2%.

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>

    <description>Trough total testosterone levels were obtained at Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 7, and Day 14 to assess time to steady state. Trough concentrations over the 14-day period were used to calculate time SS.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day; drying time measured following gel application on Day 14</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Testosterone gel 2% drying time was assessed with a stopwatch. On Day 14 at the time of application of the gel directly to the first anteromedial thigh, the subject started a stopwatch. The gel was spread as evenly as possible over an area of 1 g/100 cm2. The total coverage area on the thigh was approximately equal to two (2) 3&quot;× 5&quot; postcards. The subject gently rubbed the gel with his fingertip in a circular motion (avoiding contact with the scrotal region) until the gel was dry. At this time, the stopwatch was stopped and the time expended was recorded in the eCRF.</description>

               -  Single morning serum total testosterone concentration &lt;250 ng/dL or

               -  Two (2) consecutive morning serum total testosterone concentrations &lt;300 ng/dL
                  (determined at least 1 week apart during a 3 week screening period) Total serum
                  testosterone sampling must occur between 7 AM and 11 AM at screening

          4. Have a hematocrit level ≤50% at screening

          5. Use of reliable contraception for subjects who have sexual partners of childbearing
             potential (women not of childbearing potential are defined as postmenopausal, ie,
             amenorrhea ≥1 year or permanently sterile). Reliable methods of contraception are:

               -  Barrier type devices (eg, condom, female condom, diaphragm, contraceptive
                  sponge) only in combination with a spermicide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe concomitant illness, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the
             subject at risk when participating in the trial or may influence the results of the
             trial or affect the subjects' ability to take part in the trial.

             Subjects with a history of malignancy must have a disease free status ≥5 years prior
             to starting study treatment. Subjects who have had prostate or breast cancer are not
             permitted to participate in the study.

         15. Known to be sensitive and/or has had an adverse skin reaction to testosterone hormone
             replacement therapy or topical products containing alcohol.

         16. Actively or potentially trying to start a family or requiring fertility treatment or

            <groups_desc>There was no formal hypothesis testing in this study; therefore, the sample size was based on the precisions of the estimates for the median time to target eugonadal range. The time that it took for total serum testosterone to reach the eugonadal range of ≥300 ng/dL was estimated for each subject using a linear interpolation method. Median time to eugonadal range and its 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using an exponential model.</groups_desc>

        <title>Gel Drying Time</title>
        <description>Testosterone gel 2% drying time was assessed with a stopwatch. On Day 14 at the time of application of the gel directly to the first anteromedial thigh, the subject started a stopwatch. The gel was spread as evenly as possible over an area of 1 g/100 cm2. The total coverage area on the thigh was approximately equal to two (2) 3”× 5” postcards. The subject gently rubbed the gel with his fingertip in a circular motion (avoiding contact with the scrotal region) until the gel was dry. At this time, the stopwatch was stopped and the time expended was recorded in the eCRF.</description>
