      The purpose of this study was to describe mean differences in corneal staining (type and
      area) for OPTI-FREE PureMoist Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) at Day 30 compared
      to Baseline (Day 0).

    <description>Percentage corneal staining was assessed by the investigator for each of five regions of the cornea; i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled flourescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and yellow filter. Percentage corneal staining was recorded in increments of ten, and the percentages of the five regions were averaged together.</description>

    <description>Corneal staining type was assessed by the investigator for each of five regions of the cornea, i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled flourescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and yellow filter. Corneal staining type was recorded on a 5-point scale for each region: 0=none; 1=micropunctate; 2=macropunctate; 3=coalesced macropunctate; 4=patch (&gt;/= 1 mm). The five regions were summed, for a summed total range of 0-20.</description>
