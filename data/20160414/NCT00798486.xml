      The purpose of this study was to assure that consumers could successfully use the new
      version of A1CNow+ Test Kit along with revised instructional materials. The primary
      objective was to establish accuracy and secondary objectives were to establish precision,
      comprehension of instructional materials, and user feedback about the overall testing
      experience.
