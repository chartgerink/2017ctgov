      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a computerized intervention designed to
      change the nature of attention biases will be effective in reducing the symptoms of post
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in American combat veterans returning from the wars in
      Afghanistan and Iraq.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan are the
      largest sustained ground operations since the Vietnam War, and the psychological effects of
      combat on military personnel can be devastating. Approximately thirty percent of returning
      veterans present with mental health problems. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the
      most common problem in this group (52% of overall diagnoses). This translates into PTSD
      prevalence rates of 12% in Afghani veterans and 19% for Iraqi veterans, rates that are two
      to three times higher than the overall lifetime prevalence rate in the general population
      (8%). Of those veterans screened positive for mental health problems 70% have not received
      any mental health services. Therefore, even for individuals identified as having
      psychological problems the majority are not receiving any help. Prevention and treatment of
      this disorder represents one of the greatest challenges facing government officials and
      health care professionals working with combat veteran populations.

      PTSD often manifests after the experience of a trauma in which individuals undergo threat of
      injury or death to themselves or others. The experience includes intense feelings of fear,
      helplessness, and/or horror. Symptoms of this disorder are often chronic lasting for years.
      Those with PTSD are likely to experience problems across several life domains including
      higher rates of divorce, problems raising children, and engaging in domestic violence. They
      are also more likely to suffer from other mental health problems including depression,
      substance abuse, and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, they tend to report less life
      satisfaction, experience poorer physical health, earn less money, and change jobs
      frequently.

      Although effective treatments do exist for PTSD, as many as 44% of individuals do not
      respond to psychosocial and pharmacological treatments. Thus, there is a clear need to
      develop highly effective and efficient treatments for PTSD. Researchers have established a
      relationship between PTSD and difficulty disengaging attention from threat relevant
      inforamtion. This knowledge; however, has not been translated into more effective treatments
      for this disorder. This three-year proposal aims to test a computerized treatment for PTSD
      in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that would bridge research on attention bias and
      treatment development. Those in the active condition will receive a computer-delivered
      attention modification program (AMP) designed to enhance attention disengagement from
      threatening stimuli. The AMP protocol includes six weeks of biweekly sessions in which
      participants see 240 trials consisting of the various combinations of probe type (E or F),
      probe position (top or bottom), and word type (Neutral or Trauma). Of the 240 trials, 48
      include only neutral words: 2 (probe type) X 2 (probe position) X 12 (word pairs). The
      remaining 192 trials include one neutral word and one trauma word: 2 (probe type) X 2 (probe
      position) X 2 (repetitions) X 24 (word pairs). On trials where participants see one neutral
      word and one trauma word (i.e., 80% of the trials), the probe always follows the neutral
      word. Thus, although there is no specific instruction to direct attention away from threat
      word, on 80% of the trials the position of the threat word indicates the position of the
      probe (i.e., in the location opposite the threat word). The placebo condition (PC) will be
      identical to the AMP condition except that during the presentation of threat-neutral word
      pairs, the probe will appear with equal frequency in the position of threat and neutral
      words. Thus, neither threat nor neutral words have signal value. We have used a very similar
      training procedure to successfully establish a pattern of enhanced attention disengagement
      to threat words in our pilot studies.

      We present the results from 2 clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of attention
      modification programs (AMP) in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. Specifically, we report
      results from studies of individuals with generalized social phobia (GSP; n=32) and
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n=24) demonstrating the effectiveness of the procedures
      described in this proposal. In brief, our intervention was effective in: a) changing biased
      attention, b) reducing clinical symptoms of anxiety, c) maintaining its effects in up to one
      year follow-up. This efficient and efficacious technique for changing attention bias in
      anxiety can provide a low-cost, easy to administer treatment that is grounded in basic
      cognitive science that may help reduce suffering in individuals with anxiety. The goal of
      the current proposal is to extend these findings to the highly related disorder of PTSD, and
      to examine the generalizability of the results to individuals with comorbid conditions. In
      the current proposal we will test two hypotheses: 1) Individuals with PTSD completing the
      AMP will show a larger reduction in their attention bias to threat compared to the placebo
      group, 2) Individuals with PTSD completing AMP will show a larger reduction in anxiety
      symptoms compared to the placebo group.

    <description>The PCL-M is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of PTSD symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely,&quot; with a minimum score of 17 and a maximum score of 85 (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1993). Participants are asked to rate to what extent they experienced PTSD symptoms over the previous month due to prior combat experiences. The military version of the PCL (PCL-M) refers specifically to a traumatic military related event (Weathers, Litz, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1994). Research suggests that the PCL-M has good test-retest reliability (r = .70) and internal consistency (alpha = .97; Weathers et al., 1993).</description>

        <description>The PCL-M is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of PTSD symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely,” with a minimum score of 17 and a maximum score of 85 (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1993). Participants are asked to rate to what extent they experienced PTSD symptoms over the previous month due to prior combat experiences.

            <title>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M)</title>
            <description>The PCL-M is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of PTSD symptoms using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely,” with a minimum score of 17 and a maximum score of 85 (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1993). Participants are asked to rate to what extent they experienced PTSD symptoms over the previous month due to prior combat experiences. The military version of the PCL (PCL-M) refers specifically to a traumatic military related event (Weathers, Litz, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1994). Research suggests that the PCL-M has good test-retest reliability (r = .70) and internal consistency (alpha = .97; Weathers et al., 1993).</description>

          <title>1 Attention Bias Modification (ABM)</title>
          <description>The ABM comprised a probe detection paradigm described above, modified to facilitate the allocation of attention away from threatening material. In this task, the probe always replaced the neutral word. Stimuli comprised a different set of 12 threat-neutral word pairs different than those used in the attention bias assessment. Participants completed 288 training trials: 2 (probe type) x 2 (probe location) x 2 (threat location) x 12 (threat-neutral word pairs) x 3 (repetition). Thus, although there were no explicit instructions to direct attention away from threat words, on all trials, the position of the neutral word indicated the position of the probe.</description>

          <title>2 Attention Control Condition (ACC)</title>
          <description>The ACC condition was identical to the ABM procedure with the exception that the probe appeared with equal frequency in the position of the threat and neutral words, such that attention was neither trained towards nor away from threat.</description>
