      The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the safety of the Hair2Go device when used
      frequently. The secondary endpoints include the kinetics of the hair clearance up to 8 weeks
      after the last treatment, and gathering information about the pain associated with the
      procedure

    <description>The immediate skin reaction and long-term side and adverse effects were evaluated on site by a dermatologist. This includes the following clinical outcomes:
Presence of transient (disappearing &lt; 24 hours) or prolonged erythema
Presence of transient (disappearing &lt; 24 hours) or prolonged edema
Self-limited bleeding from mechanical shaving
Blister formation
Ulcer formation
Pigment changes (hypo/hyper)
