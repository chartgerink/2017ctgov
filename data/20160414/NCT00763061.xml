            <description>Bilateral IOP measurements by Goldmann applanation were performed at 9AM and 4 PM. Two IOP measurements were taken and averaged. If the difference between the first and second reading was greater than 4 mmHg, a third reading was taken and the two nearest readings averaged.</description>
