  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment on dry eye syndrome. Study
      hypothesis is that a standardized acupuncture would be more effective than a sham
      acupuncture in dry eye syndrome patients. This is a randomized, patients-assessor blinded,
      sham acupuncture controlled study. Additionally, the investigators will assess the safety of
      acupuncture treatment.

    <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 equals &quot;all of the time&quot;. OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.</description>

        <title>Ocular Surface Disease Index : OSDI</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals “none of the time” and 4 equals “all of the time”. OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.</description>

            <title>Ocular Surface Disease Index : OSDI</title>
            <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals “none of the time” and 4 equals “all of the time”. OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.</description>
