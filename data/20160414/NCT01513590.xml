  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia and Europe. The aim of the trial is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart and BIAsp 30 (biphasic insulin aspart
      30) in insulin naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes.

            <description>Responder for HbA1c (&lt;7.0%) without severe and minor treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes during the last 12 weeks of treatment. Severe + minor hypoglycaemic episodes = confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes: requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes: able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>
