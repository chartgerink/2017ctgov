  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the blood
      sugar lowering effect of repaglinide plus metformin as initial treatment compared to
      repaglinide alone in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes having an HbA1c (glycosylated
      haemoglobin A1c) over 8.5 % and who never have taken oral sugar-lowering drugs before. The
      associated unfavourable events including low blood sugar episodes between the two treatments
      are also compared.

During the dose titration period of 6 weeks, the dose could be titrated up to repaglinide 4 mg and metformin 500 mg three times daily, according to fasting glucose values. The minimal dose was repaglinide 1 mg plus metformin 500 mg three times daily.</description>

          <description>Initial dose of repaglinide 1mg plus metformin 500mg once daily. During the dose titration period of 6 weeks, the dose could be titrated up to repaglinide 4 mg and metformin 500 mg three times daily, according to fasting glucose values. The minimal dose was repaglinide 1 mg plus metformin 500 mg three times daily.</description>
