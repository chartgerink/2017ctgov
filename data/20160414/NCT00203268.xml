  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study examining a migraine medicine dihydroergotamine mesylate
      (DHE-45).It will be used to treat two migraine attacks in subjects who have a history of
      skin sensitivity associated with their headaches.This skin sensitivity is called cutaneous
      allodynia (pronounced q-tay-nee-us al-o-din-ee-uh).Cutaneous allodynia is a sensation of
      pain when a non-noxious stimulus is applied to normal skin. It has been noted in several
      studies that in subjects with migraine, seventy nine percent of the subjects experienced
      allodynia on the facial skin on the same side as the headache. It has also been shown that
      that once allodynia develops, other migraine medicines that would normally be very effective
      for migraine pain, become much less effective or ineffective. This study will compare the
      differences,if any, in attacks treated early with this study drug and treated later with the
      same study drug. It is hoped that that this trial will provide information on the use of
      DHE-45 in subjects who have cutaneous allodynia. Understanding more about allodynia may help
      us understand how the pain system works in migraine.

    <description>Data was collected at 2 hours post treatment to assess pain level. This assessment was done when subjects treated a migraine early (defined as treatment at 2 hours after onset of throbbing pain)and then late (defined as treatment at 4 hours after onset of throbbing pain). The proportion of subjects reporting headache relief at the 2 hour post treatment assessment was determined for each group and then compared.</description>

             screening

          -  Subjects who experience between 3-10 migraine attacks per month (during the previous
             6 months) with no more than 15 days of headache per month.
