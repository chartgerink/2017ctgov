  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new questionnaire to capture the patient
      experience of COPD. The information collected will be used to validate the Shortness of
      Breath with Daily Activities Questionnaire.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea, referred to by patients as &quot;shortness of breath&quot; or &quot;breathlessness,&quot; is frequently
      associated with decreases in functional status, quality of life, and disabilities. Currently
      available questionnaires do not specifically address the shortness of breath component of
      COPD. The development of a patient reported outcome questionnaire that will specifically
      assess Shortness of Breath with Daily Activities (SOBDA) in patients with COPD is needed.

    <measure>Internal Consistency (IC) of the Shortness of Breath With Daily Activities (SOBDA) Questionnaire in Participants With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessed as Cronbach's Alpha Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of the 2-week Run-in Period</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cronbach's alpha (CA) is a measure of the IC of the 13-item SOBDA questionnaire (completed via electronic diary by a sample of participants). It is the ratio of the variance (var.) of the sum of the individual scores and the var. of the total score. The var. of the sum of a group of independent variables is the sum of their var.; thus, if the variables are positively correlated, the var. of the sum will be increased. If the items making up the score are identical and so perfectly correlated, CA=1. If the items are independent, CA=0. Higher scores indicate a more reliable (precise) instrument.</description>

    <measure>Test-retest Reliability (T-RR) of SOBDA Scores Measured as the Difference in the SOBDA Weekly Score Between Week 1 and Week 2 of the 2-week Run-in Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 2 of the 2-week Run-in Period</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>T-RR=stability during repeat measures over time in a stable population. SOBDA score was determined by the 13-item (it.) scoring algorithm, assigning a weekly mean score of 1-4 (higher scores=more severe breathlessness with daily activities) based on the mean of 7 days of data (or &gt;=4 days). Daily total score is computed from the mean of the participant's (par.) scores on the 13 it. (&gt;=7 it. must have non-missing responses). Only scores of stable par. (indicating no change [score=3] on the par.-completed Patient Global Assessment of Change [PGAC]; 1 [ much worse] to 5 [much better]) were used.</description>

    <measure>Convergent Validity for the SOBDA Questionnaire Measured as Correlations of the Baseline SOBDA Score With Participant-completed Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) and Physician-completed mMRC Scores at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last week of the 2-week Run-in Period) and pre-treatment on Visit 2 (Day 1 of the 6-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Convergent validity is defined as the ability of the SOBDA questionnaire to measure required information and was assessed by examining the relationship between the SOBDA score and the participant/physician-completed mMRC Dyspnea Scale assessments. The physician/participant rated the degree of the participant's dyspnea (trouble breathing) on the 5-point mMRC scale (0, none; 4, very severe). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assesses if the relationship between two variables is monotone. A correlation of +1 or -1 will occur if one variable is a perfect monotone of the other.</description>

    <description>Convergent validity is defined as the ability of the SOBDA questionnaire to measure required information and was assessed by examining the relationship between the SOBDA score and the CRQ-SAS dyspnea domain score. Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear dependence between 2 variables. A correlation of +1 or -1 will occur if the data from the 2 variables lie exactly on a line. The CRQ is a 20-item instrument measuring 4 domains (each measured on a scale of 1 [maximum impairment] to 7 [no impairment]) of functioning: mastery, fatigue, emotional function, and dyspnea.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SOBDA known group validity refers to the extent to which scores from the SOBDA questionnaire should differentiate participants with varying levels of dyspnea severity. It was assessed by comparing summary measures for the SOBDA score for each indicated level (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) of the PyC mMRC. The physician rated the degree of the participant's dyspnea on the 5-point mMRC scale: 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). Known group validity was confirmed if the SOBDA score increased with increasing values of PyC mMRC, both indicating increased levels of breathlessness.</description>

        <title>Internal Consistency (IC) of the Shortness of Breath With Daily Activities (SOBDA) Questionnaire in Participants With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessed as Cronbach's Alpha Value</title>
        <description>Cronbach’s alpha (CA) is a measure of the IC of the 13-item SOBDA questionnaire (completed via electronic diary by a sample of participants). It is the ratio of the variance (var.) of the sum of the individual scores and the var. of the total score. The var. of the sum of a group of independent variables is the sum of their var.; thus, if the variables are positively correlated, the var. of the sum will be increased. If the items making up the score are identical and so perfectly correlated, CA=1. If the items are independent, CA=0. Higher scores indicate a more reliable (precise) instrument.</description>

        <title>Convergent Validity for the SOBDA Questionnaire Measured as Correlations of the Baseline SOBDA Score With Participant-completed Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) and Physician-completed mMRC Scores at Visit 2</title>
        <description>Convergent validity is defined as the ability of the SOBDA questionnaire to measure required information and was assessed by examining the relationship between the SOBDA score and the participant/physician-completed mMRC Dyspnea Scale assessments. The physician/participant rated the degree of the participant's dyspnea (trouble breathing) on the 5-point mMRC scale (0, none; 4, very severe). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assesses if the relationship between two variables is monotone. A correlation of +1 or -1 will occur if one variable is a perfect monotone of the other.</description>

            <description>Convergent validity is defined as the ability of the SOBDA questionnaire to measure required information and was assessed by examining the relationship between the SOBDA score and the participant/physician-completed mMRC Dyspnea Scale assessments. The physician/participant rated the degree of the participant's dyspnea (trouble breathing) on the 5-point mMRC scale (0, none; 4, very severe). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assesses if the relationship between two variables is monotone. A correlation of +1 or -1 will occur if one variable is a perfect monotone of the other.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last Treatment Week in the SOBDA Score by CRQ-SAS Dyspnea Domain (DD) Responses at Visit 3/PD</title>
        <description>The responsiveness of the SOBDA questionnaire was assessed by comparing score changes of responders (Rs) versus non-responders (NRs). The CRQ-SAS DD includes 5 questions (q.) scored 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). Individual q. were equally weighted, and domain scores (DSs) (range=1-7) were calculated as the mean across the non-missing items within each domain (DSs were calculated although an individual item score was missing). Changes in mean SOBDA scores during the last treatment week in Rs and NRs using definitions based on the CRQ-SAS DD conducted at Visit 3/PD were assessed.</description>

        <title>SOBDA Threshold for Response as Assessed by Mean Change From Baseline to the Last Treatment Week in the SOBDA Score Based on a CRQ-SAS Dyspnea Domain (DD) Response Rated as “Better”</title>
        <description>The threshold of response (TOR) is a score change in the SOBDA questionnaire that is demonstrated to have a perceivable benefit. The TOR was evaluated as the change from Baseline in the SOBDA score based on CRQ-SAS scores pre-specified as “better” or demonstrating meaningful improvement. The CRQ-SAS DD includes 5 questions (q.) scored 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). Individual q. were equally weighted, and domain scores (DSs) (range=1-7) were calculated as the mean across the non-missing items within each domain (DSs were calculated although an individual item score was missing).</description>

        <population>MITT Population. Analyses were conducted on data available for each specified time point. As pre-specified in the study protocol, results are presented independent of treatment allocation. The study objectives were to assess the measurement properties and validity of the SOBDA questionnaire independent of specific treatment effect.</population>
