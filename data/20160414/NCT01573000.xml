      Subjects were randomized to receive either tositumomab (Anti-B1 Antibody) and iodine I 131
      tositumomab (Arm A) or unlabeled tositumomab (Arm B). Subjects randomized to Arm B were
      allowed to cross over and receive I 131 tositumomab once their disease had progressed as
      long as they still fulfilled the protocol entry criteria (except for exclusion criterion 12,
      prior monoclonal antibody therapy) and were human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) negative.
      Study endpoint assessments of response were conducted by a Masked Independent Randomized
      Radiographic and Oncologic Review (MIRROR) panel and the Study Investigators' assessments of
      safety and survival. Subjects who completed at least two years of follow-up in Protocol
      BEX104515 (formerly Corixa Protocol RIT-II-002) were enrolled in long term follow-up
      Protocol BEX104526 (formerly Corixa Protocol CCBX001-051), an administrative protocol, for
      continued radiographic response evaluations and safety evaluations every 6 months for years
      3 through 5 post-treatment and annually for years 6 through 10 post-treatment. Subjects in
      BEX104526 were assessed for survival, disease status, subsequent therapy for NHL, and
      long-term safety, including the use of thyroid medication, development of hypothyroidism,
      human anti murine antibody (HAMA), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and
      all other secondary malignancies. Additionally, subjects were followed for the development
      of any adverse event(s) deemed by the Principal Investigator as being possibly or probably
      related to a subject's previous treatment with Iodine I-131 tositumomab. Laboratory
      evaluations consisting of a thyroid stimulating hormone level and a complete blood cell
      count, with a differential and platelet count, were obtained annually through year 10
      post-treatment.

      Dosimetric Dose: Subjects received 450 mg of tositumomab IV followed by 5.0 mCi of Iodine
      I-131 and 35 mg of tositumomab. Following the dosimetric dose, whole body dosimetry was
      performed on each subject using a total body gamma camera. Whole body anterior and posterior
      whole body images were obtained at the following timepoints.

        1. Within one hour of infusion of the dosimetric dose and prior to urination

        2. 2-4 days after infusion of the dosimetric dose, following urination

        3. 6-7 days after infusion of the dosimetric dose, following urination Therapeutic Dose:
           The total body residence time, derived from total body gamma camera counts obtained at
           the 3 time points, was used to calculate the iodine-131 activity (mCi) to be
           administered to deliver the therapeutic total body irradiation dose of 65 or 75 cGy.
           The therapeutic step was administered 7-14 days after the dosimetric step and consisted
           of tositumomab 450 mg followed by an activity (mCi) of iodine-131 calculated to deliver
           75 cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg of
           tositumomab.

      For subjects with ≥150,000 platelets/mm3, the recommended dose was the activity of
      iodine-131 calculated to deliver 75 cGy of total body irradiation; for subjects with NCI
      Grade 1 thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ≥100,000 but &lt;150,000 platelets/mm3), the
      recommended dose was the activity of iodine-131 calculated to deliver 65 cGy of total body
      irradiation.

      This is a Phase II randomized, controlled, two-arm, open-label, multicenter study comparing
      the safety and efficacy of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab to tositumomab for the
      treatment of chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory low-grade or transformed low-grade B-cell
      NHL.

      Treatment Arm A: Subject will undergo 2 phases of study. In the first phase, termed
      &quot;dosimetric dose&quot;, subjects will receive tositumomab (450 mg) followed by tositumomab (35
      mg) that has been trace labeled with 5mCi) Iodine-131 tositumomab. Whole body gamma camera
      scans will be obtained on day 0, day 2, 3, or 4, and day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric
      dose. Using the dosimetric data from three imaging time points, a subject-specific dose of
      iodine I 131 tositumomab to deliver the desired total body dose of radiotherapy will be
      calculated. In the second phase of the study, termed &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, subjects will
      receive unlabeled tositumomab (450mg) followed by iodine tositumomab (35mg) labeled with the
      subject-specific dose of iodine I-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to subjects.
      Subjects with platelet counts of 100,001 - 149,999 cells/mm3, will receive 65 cGy and
      subjects who are obese will be doses based on 137% of their lean body mass. Subjects will be
      treated with either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or
      potassium iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the
      Iodine-131 tositumomab (i.e., the dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the
      last infusion of radiolabeled tositumomab (i.e., the therapeutic dose).

      Treatment Arm B: Subjects will receive the same amount of unlabeled tositumomab (450 + 35
      mg) administered over the same time-frame as Arm A on the study Days 0 and 7 (the day 7 dose
      may be delayed but no longer than 14 days after the first dose).

      Crossover treatment Arm B: Subjects in Arm B may crossover and receive Iodine-131
      tositumomab following progression of their lymphoma if they still fulfill the protocol
      inclusion exclusion criteria (except exclusion criteria#12) and are HAMA-negative.

    <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>

    <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants in this study were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed human anti-mouse antibodies above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of human anti-mouse antibodies.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Drug-Related (DR) Adverse Events (AEs) Experienced by 3 or More Participants</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Causality of AEs was determined by the investigators as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;remote,&quot; &quot;possible,&quot; &quot;probable,&quot; or &quot;highly probable.&quot; AEs considered by the investigator as being at least remotely related to the study treatment were considered to be DR AEs. White blood cell (WBC) count and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were measured as cells per millimeters cubed (mm^3); hemoglobin was measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>

            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Infection</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>

            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.

            <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment. Relatedness was based on the investigator's medical judgement.</description>

        <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants in this study were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed human anti-mouse antibodies above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of human anti-mouse antibodies.</description>
