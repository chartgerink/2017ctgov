  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention
      designed to increase attendance of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients at
      Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) on actual CRP participation rate and; examine
      patient-related factors (demographic, health, psychosocial, awareness) influencing patients'
      attendance at CRPs. We hypothesized that the proportion of CABG patients participating in
      CRPs will increase significantly to 20-30% following the educational intervention employed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of disability and economic burden in western
      societies. Ample evidence exists to suggest that participation of these patients in
      structured Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) is beneficial in terms of improved
      prognosis and quality of life. Despite inclusion of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in the
      Medical Insurance Basket (MIB) as a treatment for patients after an acute myocardial
      infarction (MI), for those after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and more recently
      for patients suffering from congestive heart failure, only a small proportion (5%-7.5%) of
      patients take part in CRPs in Israel. Several factors have been identified as barriers to
      CRP in Israel, two of which are lack of patients motivation to participate in CRPs stemming,
      in part, from lack of awareness regarding the importance of CR and its availability and;
      Lack of motivation of medical staff to refer patients to CR resulting from a unawareness of
      the importance of CR and its availability across Israel, to name a few. The present study
      accords with such recommendations, by proposing a simple intervention designed to improve
      patients' and medical staff's awareness to the importance of CR participation. It is
      expected that CRP participation will significantly increase to 20-30% following the
      educational intervention employed.

      This intervention will provide the basis for the implementation of an intervention to
      increase CRP participation in cardiac patients at a national level.

      In addition to increasing the proportion of CABG patients attending at CRPs, the study aims
      to measure the effect of CRP participation on subsequent 1-year health and behavior related
      outcomes, and 3-year mortality. We expect to find differences in outcome measures between
      participating patients and those who do not.

A recommendation to the general physician to refer the patient to CRP was added to the letter of discharge from hospital.</description>
