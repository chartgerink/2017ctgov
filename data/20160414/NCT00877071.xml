      Advanced HCC represents a high unmet medical need with a poor prognosis and few therapeutic
      options. Patients who present with HCC beyond the currently accepted Milan criteria are not
      eligible to be listed for liver transplantation. The proposed study offers local regional
      therapy to a defined population of patients beyond Milan criteria as an attempt to downstage
      them to eligibility for liver transplant.

      LC BeadTM is a new product specifically designed for TACE. LC BeadTM microspheres can be
      loaded with doxorubicin (Trade name: adriamycin), a chemotherapeutic anthracycline glycolide
      agent widely accepted for treatment of HCC. This novel bead slowly releases the ionically
      bound chemotherapeutic agent rather than administering a bolus of chemotherapy as is the
      case with many alternative methods of TACE. Thus, the LC BeadTM offers the potential
      advantage of less toxicity and prolonged tumor exposure.

      This study offers local regional therapy to a defined population of patients beyond
      transplant criteria as an attempt to downstage them to eligibility for liver
      transplantation. This study will make an important contribution to understanding the beads'
      local effect as seen in the explanted livers of those patients who go on to receive a liver
      transplant. Additionally, we will examine the impact of this novel treatment tool on
      patients' quality of life.

            <title>The Number of Patients in the Cohort Effectively Downstaged to Transplant Eligibility With the LC BeadTM</title>
            <description>Advanced HCC represents a high unmet medical need with a poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. Patients who present with HCC beyond the currently accepted Milan criteria are not eligible to be listed for liver transplantation. The proposed study offers local regional therapy to both a defined population of patients beyond Milan criteria as an attempt to downstage them to eligibility for liver transplant as well as those individuals within Milan criteria as an attempt to maintain their eligibility.</description>

LC Bead loaded with doxorubicin: LC Bead is a new product specifically designed for TACE. LC Bead microspheres will be loaded with between 50-100mg of doxorubicin for each of several TACE procedures. The bead will utilize embolic induced ischemia as well as local chemotherapy in an effort to downstage unresectable HCC to liver transplantation</description>
