  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for hypersensitivity symptoms upon
      repeat exposure to sugammadex. Healthy participants will be randomized to one of three
      treatment arms: sugammadex 4 mg/kg, sugammadex 16 mg/kg or placebo. Participants will
      receive 3 single intravenous (IV) doses of their randomized treatment, with an approximately
      5-week washout between Dose 1 and Dose 2 and between Dose 2 and Dose 3. Participants will be
      confined at the study center from the day before each dose until completion of the 24-hour
      post dose assessments.

    <description>The investigator or designated clinician performed a targeted hypersensitivity assessment (THA) in each participant at 0.5, 4 and 24 hours after each dose for each dosing period. The THA could also be performed at other times if possible hypersensitivity signs were observed. The THA included elicitation of symptoms as well as examination of the participant, covering neurologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and dermatologic domains. Each potential hypersensitivity case identified by the presence of any sign or symptom in a pre-defined list of hypersensitivity signs and symptoms that were found through the THA was reviewed by an independent, blinded adjudication committee, which determined whether the referred case was a case of hypersensitivity (yes/no). In addition, all adverse events (AEs) occurring in study were reviewed for terms associated with hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis, and could also result in referral to the adjudication committee for evaluation.</description>

Each potential hypersensitivity case identified by presence of any sign or symptom in a pre-defined list of hypersensitivity signs and symptoms that were found through the THA was reviewed by an independent, blinded adjudication committee, which determined whether the referred case was a case of anaphylaxis (yes/no) using Sampson Criterion 1 - Acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue or both, and at least one of the following: a) respiratory compromise, b) reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-397). All AEs occurring in study were reviewed for terms associated with hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis, and could also result in referral to the adjudication committee for evaluation.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Adjudicated Symptoms of Hypersensitivity</title>
        <description>The investigator or designated clinician performed a targeted hypersensitivity assessment (THA) in each participant at 0.5, 4 and 24 hours after each dose for each dosing period. The THA could also be performed at other times if possible hypersensitivity signs were observed. The THA included elicitation of symptoms as well as examination of the participant, covering neurologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and dermatologic domains. Each potential hypersensitivity case identified by the presence of any sign or symptom in a pre-defined list of hypersensitivity signs and symptoms that were found through the THA was reviewed by an independent, blinded adjudication committee, which determined whether the referred case was a case of hypersensitivity (yes/no). In addition, all adverse events (AEs) occurring in study were reviewed for terms associated with hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis, and could also result in referral to the adjudication committee for evaluation.</description>
