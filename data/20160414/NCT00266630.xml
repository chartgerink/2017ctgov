        <description>A scale used to assess the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. Consists of 9 items (8 to assess individual symptoms and 1 to assess global severity). Each item is assessed from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The total points of 8 items are defined as DIEPSS total (0 to 32 points). The items for the assessment of individual symptoms are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia. Parkinsonism is assessed by the total points of items 1 to 5; akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia are assessed by the points given to the corresponding items.</description>
