  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to determine whether acetaminophen is an
      effective pain reliever for primary cleft palate repair in children and possesses opioid
      sparing effects. Additionally, the investigators will determine if patients who receive
      acetaminophen have less opioid related side-effects. The study will have three study groups
      based on whether the patient receives Ofirmev® and opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine), oral
      acetaminophen elixir and opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine), or opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine)
      alone. Total opioid (Fentanyl and Morphine) consumption will be tracked for the
      intraoperative period and 24 hours after surgery for all patients within the study and
      converted to morphine equivalents.

    <description>Oral inert cherry syrup will be administered preoperatively as placebo for oral acetaminophen. Ofirmev® will be administered in the operating room once intravenous access is established. Patients will receive standardized dose of local anesthetic (Lidocaine 0.5% with Epinephrine) infiltration by the surgeon before surgical incision as well as at the completion of surgery with Bupivacaine 0.25% with Epinephrine. Postoperatively patients will receive Ofirmev® every 6 hours as well as placebo oral cherry elixir every 6 hours and morphine as needed for 24 hours.</description>

            <description>Oral inert cherry syrup will be administered preoperatively as placebo for oral acetaminophen. Ofirmev will be administered in the operating room once intravenous access is established. Patients will receive standardized dose of local anesthetic (Lidocaine 0.5% with Epinephrine) infiltration by the surgeon before surgical incision as well as at the completion of surgery with Bupivacaine 0.25% with Epinephrine. Postoperatively patients will receive Ofirmev® every 6 hours as well as placebo oral cherry elixir every 6 hours and morphine as needed for 24 hours.
Ofirmev®: Intravenous acetaminophen is initiated after intravenous access is obtained intraoperatively and before surgical incision. Dosing is age based as follows: 5 months-2 years 12.5 mg/kg, 2-5 years 15 mg/kg. Redosing will be every 6 hours for 24 hours. The two other arms will receive a placebo in the form of normal saline given intravenously. Intraoperative opioids will be administered as deemed necessary by anesthesia c</description>

Intravenous morphine will be administered as needed for 24 hours.
Oral acetaminophen: Oral acetaminophen administered as a cherry flavored elixir will be dosed preoperatively 15 mg/kg and redosed every 6 hours for 24 hours.

They will receive local anesthetic (Lidocaine 0.5% with Epinephrine) infiltration by the surgeon prior to incision as well as at the completion of surgery with Bupivicaine 0.25% with Epinephrine. Postoperatively they will receive only Morphine prn for pain control.
Opioid only: Intraoperative opioids (Fentanyl or Morphine) will be administered as deemed necessary by anesthesia care team. in the PACU, fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg will be administered for moderate-severe pain. Once discharged from PACU, morphine 0.05 mg/kg will be given every 3 hours as needed.</description>
