  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The investigators propose a first-ever, prospective trial of asenapine in older
      adults with bipolar disorder (BD) to evaluate effects on mood symptoms, tolerability and
      functional/general health status. Given the dearth of treatment data on older adults with
      BD, findings are likely to be of substantial clinical interest, may inform larger future
      studies and will assist in refining bipolar treatment recommendations.

      Hypotheses:

      Primary: Asenapine therapy will be associated with reduced bipolar manic and depressive
      symptoms in older adults with BD.

      Secondary: Asenapine therapy will be associated with improved functional and general health
      status, improved global psychopathology, and good tolerability in older adults with BD.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Stroop Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Stroop evaluates patients for cognitive functioning. Patients are to read words aloud or name colors as quickly as possible in a 45-second period. The measure contains three tasks, each associated with a subscale as follows: Word, Color, and Color-Word. Each subscale contains 100 items. The raw score range for each of the subscales is 0-100. Each raw subscale score is converted to a T-Score. The possible T-Score range for the Word subscale is 15 to 85. The possible T-Score range for the Color subscale is 8 to 92. The possible T-Score range for the Color-Word subscale is 3 to 98. Higher scores on the subscales indicate better cognitive functioning. Subscales are scored independently and are not added to produce a total score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Trails test is a measure of cognitive functioning. The measure consists of two parts: A and B. In part A, participants are asked to draw a trail connecting a series of numbers in sequential order. In Part B, participants are asked to draw a trail connecting a combination of letters and numbers. The time taken to complete each task is noted as the score (e.g., 78 seconds). For Trails A, there is no upper limit on the score, as subjects are given as much time as is needed for them to complete the task. Higher scores indicate poorer cognitive functioning. In Trails B, the task is timed with an upper limit of five minutes. If, at four minutes, it is determined that the subject will not likely complete the task in the time allotted, then the task can be called off. Higher scores indicate poorer cognitive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Evaluates cognitive functioning across domains: recall, delayed recall, retention, recognition (each scored separately). The scores given are titled: recall score, delayed recall score, retention score, recognition discrimination index. Total Recall score = items correctly recalled (0-36). Delayed Recall score = items correctly recalled following delay (0-12). Retention score = percent items recalled that were also recalled after delay (0-100). The Recognition Discrimination score = true positives minus false positives (0-12). Recall task has 12 words and involves to recall of words after all of them are read aloud to the patient. Delayed recall tasks involves the same twelve words, except recall is tasked after a 20-25 minute delay. Recognition task has 24 words. Patient evaluated on how many from original list he or she is able to recognize. Higher scores = better outcomes.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The DRS contains items that evaluate cognitive function across 5 subscales: attention, initiation/perseveration, construction, conceptualization, and memory. Subscale raw score ranges are: attention (0-37), initiation/perseveration (0-37), construction (0-6), conceptualization (0-39), and memory (0-25). Raw subscale scores are added for a total raw score with range 0-144. For each raw subscale score, scaled scores are looked up from a battery of 13 tables. Age of the participant determines which table is to be used. Total raw subscale score also has its own scaled score in the tables. In addition to use in determining scaled scores for each of the subscales, these tables are used to look up the scaled score for the total raw score. The tables are contained in the article Robust and Expanded Norms for the Dementia Rating Scale (Pedraza, Lucas, et al. 2010); Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology 25; 347-358. Higher scores, raw and scaled, indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Stroop Task</title>
        <description>The Stroop evaluates patients for cognitive functioning. Patients are to read words aloud or name colors as quickly as possible in a 45-second period. The measure contains three tasks, each associated with a subscale as follows: Word, Color, and Color-Word. Each subscale contains 100 items. The raw score range for each of the subscales is 0-100. Each raw subscale score is converted to a T-Score. The possible T-Score range for the Word subscale is 15 to 85. The possible T-Score range for the Color subscale is 8 to 92. The possible T-Score range for the Color-Word subscale is 3 to 98. Higher scores on the subscales indicate better cognitive functioning. Subscales are scored independently and are not added to produce a total score.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Trail Making Test</title>
        <description>The Trails test is a measure of cognitive functioning. The measure consists of two parts: A and B. In part A, participants are asked to draw a trail connecting a series of numbers in sequential order. In Part B, participants are asked to draw a trail connecting a combination of letters and numbers. The time taken to complete each task is noted as the score (e.g., 78 seconds). For Trails A, there is no upper limit on the score, as subjects are given as much time as is needed for them to complete the task. Higher scores indicate poorer cognitive functioning. In Trails B, the task is timed with an upper limit of five minutes. If, at four minutes, it is determined that the subject will not likely complete the task in the time allotted, then the task can be called off. Higher scores indicate poorer cognitive functioning.</description>

The scores given are titled: recall score, delayed recall score, retention score, recognition discrimination index. Total Recall score = items correctly recalled (0-36). Delayed Recall score = items correctly recalled following delay (0-12). Retention score = percent items recalled that were also recalled after delay (0-100). The Recognition Discrimination score = true positives minus false positives (0-12). Recall task has 12 words and involves to recall of words after all of them are read aloud to the patient. Delayed recall tasks involves the same twelve words, except recall is tasked after a 20-25 minute delay. Recognition task has 24 words. Patient evaluated on how many from original list he or she is able to recognize. Higher scores = better outcomes.

Subscale raw score ranges are: attention (0-37), initiation/perseveration (0-37), construction (0-6), conceptualization (0-39), and memory (0-25). Raw subscale scores are added for a total raw score with range 0-144. For each raw subscale score, scaled scores are looked up from a battery of 13 tables. Age of the participant determines which table is to be used. Total raw subscale score also has its own scaled score in the tables. In addition to use in determining scaled scores for each of the subscales, these tables are used to look up the scaled score for the total raw score. The tables are contained in the article Robust and Expanded Norms for the Dementia Rating Scale (Pedraza, Lucas, et al. 2010); Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology 25; 347-358. Higher scores, raw and scaled, indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

            <description>The WHO-DAS II is used to assess patients for difficulties that they experience due to health conditions. Six subscales are represented which cover the following domains: Getting Around (range 1-10), Self Care (range 1-10), Life Activities (range 1-20), Understand/Communicate (range 1-10), Participation in Society (range 1-10), and Getting Along with People (range 1-10). Lower scores represent more positive outcomes, while higher scores represent worse outcomes. Total summary scores were not computed for our analyses and is optional for the measure.</description>

The scores given are titled: recall score, delayed recall score, retention score, recognition discrimination index. Total Recall score = items correctly recalled (0-12). Delayed Recall score = items correctly recalled following delay (0-12). Retention score = percent items recalled that were also recalled after delay (0-100). The Recognition Discrimination score = true positives minus false positives (0-12). Recall task has 12 words and involves to recall of words after all of them are read aloud to the patient. Delayed recall tasks involves the same twelve words, except recall is tasked after a 20-25 minute delay. Recognition task has 24 words. Patient evaluated on how many from original list he or she is able to recognize. Higher scores = better outcomes.

Asenapine: Asenapine will be administered open-label in pill form. Asenapine will be initiated at 5 mg twice a day and increased as tolerated to a maximum of 20 mg/day. It is anticipated that maximum stable dosing will be achieved by 4 weeks of treatment, although dosage may be reduced due to tolerability concerns at the discretion of the treating research psychiatrist.</description>

            <title>Change in Cognitive Status as Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)</title>
            <description>Evaluates cognitive functioning across domains: recall, delayed recall, retention, recognition (each scored separately). The scores given are titled: recall score, delayed recall score, retention score, recognition discrimination index. Total Recall score = items correctly recalled (0-12). Delayed Recall score = items correctly recalled following delay (0-12). Retention score = percent items recalled that were also recalled after delay (0-100). The Recognition Discrimination score = true positives minus false positives (0-12). Recall task has 12 words and involves to recall of words after all of them are read aloud to the patient. Delayed recall tasks involves the same twelve words, except recall is tasked after a 20-25 minute delay. Recognition task has 24 words. Patient evaluated on how many from original list he or she is able to recognize. Higher scores = better outcomes.
