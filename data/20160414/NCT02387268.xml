  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Motus GI Colon Cleansing device is intended to facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a
      poorly prepared colon by irrigating the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid and feces.

    <textblock>
      The study aim to evaluate the post Procedure Cleansing Level as Measured by the Boston Bowel
      Preparation Scale (BBPS).

      Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen including split dose of 2
      tablets of 5mg Bysacodyle followed by a colonoscopy procedure with the tested device.
