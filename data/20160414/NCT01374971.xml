  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an Investigator-Sponsored Study to determine the
      potential immunomodulatory effects of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) treatment at the site of
      disease activity (synovial lining) in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using pre
      treatment and post treatment arthroscopic synovial biopsies and ex vivo on gene expression.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Synovial TNFa, CXCL13, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1b, IL-10, IP-10, BCL3, CD3E, DUSP4, FOXP3, CD79A, CD138, MMP-3, and MMP-1 After 12 Weeks of Treatment With Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Synovial tissue biopsy samples were taken at baseline and at 12 weeks after starting treatment with CZP. These samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of select biomarkers and to determine the percent change in concentration from baseline to week 12.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Screening in Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 ESR After 14 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Week 14</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The DAS 28 ESR is a score calculated from the results of a 28-count joint assessment (total number of tender joint possible is 28, and total number of swollen joints possible is 28), the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and the Patient Global Assessment (measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, with the lowest possible score of 0 mm meaning the subject is not affected at all by arthritis and the highest possible score of 100 mm meaning the subject is severely affected by arthritis). A lower DAS 28 ESR indicates less active disease, and a higher DAS 28 ESR indicates more active disease. The DAS 28 ESR was calculated for each subject at the screening visit and at the Week 14 final visit. The percent change was then calculated for each patient, and a mean percent change for all subjects was determined.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Screening in Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 ESR After 14 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The DAS 28 ESR is a score calculated from the results of a 28-count joint assessment (total number of tender joint possible is 28, and total number of swollen joints possible is 28), the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and the Patient Global Assessment (measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, with the lowest possible score of 0 mm meaning the subject is not affected at all by arthritis and the highest possible score of 100 mm meaning the subject is severely affected by arthritis). A lower DAS 28 ESR indicates less active disease, and a higher DAS 28 ESR indicates more active disease. The DAS 28 ESR was calculated for each subject at the screening visit and at the Week 14 final visit. The percent change was then calculated for each patient, and a mean percent change for all subjects was determined.</description>

Arthroscopic synovial tissue biopsy: Subjects will undergo arthroscopy Pre and Post Treatment. The arthroscopy will be performed on a clinically inflamed joint. A single arthroscopy procedure using a small bore arthroscope will be conducted to obtain synovial tissue in each joint in all subjects. Local anesthesia will be used only. Two small incisions will be made to accommodate the arthroscope and other instruments. Synovial biopsies will be obtained using a motorized shaver.</description>
