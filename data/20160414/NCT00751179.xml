    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, parallel group, comparative, active controlled, safety assessor
      blinded trial in adult subjects comparing rocuronium plus sugammadex versus succinylcholine
      alone in subjects undergoing short surgical procedures in out-patient surgicenters. The
      primary objective was to evaluate changes in plasma potassium levels after treatment with
      rocuronium, sugammadex, or succinylcholine in adult subjects scheduled for short surgical
      procedures in out-patient surgicenters.

    <time_frame>Start of administration of sugammadex to recovery from neuromuscular blockade (Up to approximately 6 minutes)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater the recovery from neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.</description>

    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Potassium Levels at 5 Minutes After Treatment With Rocuronium or Succinylcholine</title>
        <description>Change from baseline = 5 minutes post dose value - baseline value. Baseline levels were obtained prior to rocuronium or succinylcholine dose. Only data post rocuronium dose are included for &quot;rocuronium - sugammadex&quot; group. The change from baseline interval included most or all of the intubation/surgical period for sugammadex analysis (since sugammadex was administered at the end of the surgical procedure) but not for succinylcholine or rocuronium analyses (since these were administered immediately after the baseline measurement just prior to intubation/commencement of the surgical period).</description>
