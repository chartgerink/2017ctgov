  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the long-term use of pregabalin at doses
      up to 450 mg/day in patients with fibromyalgia who have completed 16 weeks of dosing in
      Study A0081208 (NCT00830167).

    <time_frame>Up to 53 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug was considered an adverse event (AE), without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events: those which occurred or worsened after baseline. An AE resulting in any of the following outcomes, was considered to be a serious adverse event: death; lifethreatening; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>The pain VAS is a horizontal line; 100 mm in length, self-administered by the patient to rate pain from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst possible pain). The score indicates the pain intensity during the past 1 week before a visit.

Consists of 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); The MOS Sleep Adequacy subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time). Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score) divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100; total score range = 0 to 100. A higher score means greater sleep adequacy.
