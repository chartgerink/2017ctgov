  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can improve
      detection of Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, and early esophageal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus is a leading cause of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Detection of dysplasia
      and early cancers in Barrett's esophagus can be challenging, time-consuming and expensive.
      Small lesions may be difficult to detect with standard endoscopy protocols. Confocal laser
      endomicroscopy (CLE) is a new type of endoscopy where a small confocal microscope is built
      into the tip of a standard endoscope. For this study, we are comparing confocal laser
      endomicroscopy (CLE) with targeted biopsies with standard endoscopy (EGD)and biopsy for
      Barrett's esophagus to determine if CLE is more effective for detecting dysplasia and
      cancer.

      Participants with Barrett's esophagus in this study undergo 1) CLE with targeted mucosal
      biopsies (biopsy only taken if CLE shows abnormal tissue) and 2) standard EGD with biopsies.
      The order of procedures is randomized (some patients have CLE first while others have
      standard EGD first).

    <description>The number of biopsies taken during each procedure (i.e. the number of biopsies taken during CLE, or the number of biopsies taken during standard EGD). Biopsies are taken during CLE only if CLE shows that the esophageal mucosa is abnormal. Esophageal biopsies are taken during standard EGD using a standard Barrett's esophagus protocol (4 quadrants, every 1-2 cm of the Barrett's esophagus). This analysis looks at the Barrett's patients with suspected (but not known) neoplasia.</description>

    <description>Our hypothesis was that the yield for neoplasia would be higher using confocal laser endomicroscopy compared to standard endoscopy. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in yield for neoplasia when CLE is used compared to standard endoscopy. This analysis looks specifically at patients who were referred for surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (no suspected neoplasia).</description>
