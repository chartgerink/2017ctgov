  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to facilitate radial artery access for cardiac catheterization. The
      investigators hypothesize that topical nitroglycerin and lidocaine will reduce radial artery
      spasm. Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization via the radial artery will be randomized
      to topical nitroglycerin + lidocaine versus placebo.

    <description>The cross-sectional radial artery area was measured using a high frequency linear array transducer. All ultrasound measurements were made 2 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. Each measurement was performed 3 times and averaged. At least 30 minutes after the application of topical creams, the radial artery diameter was again measured in the same fashion.</description>
