  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of birth control that is extremely effective and
      safe, even in women who have not yet had children. Women can experience high levels of pain
      when the IUD is placed inside the uterus, and fear of this pain could be a reason that women
      decide not to use this method.

      This study will randomly (like flipping a coin) assign women who have chosen the IUD as
      their contraceptive into two groups. One group will have lidocaine anesthetic gel placed
      into their cervix prior to having the IUD inserted; the other will have an inert gel placed
      into their cervix instead. The level of pain at three different time points on a 10cm scale
      and the patient's satisfaction with the procedure will be compared between the two groups to
      see if using lidocaine gel helps decrease IUD insertional pain

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intrauterine device (IUD) is a highly effective, long-acting, reversible method of
      contraception used by approximately 8% of women in the developed world. In the United
      States, historically candidates for IUDs were monogamous, parous women. Recent research has
      shown that both copper and levonorgestrel IUD use is safe and effective in nulliparous
      women. Nulliparous and parous women can experience significant amounts of pain during IUD
      insertion. Concerns about insertional pain could be a barrier to IUD initiation women and
      their healthcare providers.

      This study will recruit women at either the Family Planning Clinic or the offices of
      Columbia University Family Planning Practice who desire the copper or levonorgestrel IUD for
      birth control. Women who consent to participating in the study will be randomized to two
      groups: one group will receive 2% lidocaine gel placed in the cervix prior to IUD placement
      and the other group will receive a placebo inert gel. The primary objective of this study is
      to compare the pain scores on a 10cm visual analogue scale in the two groups after tenaculum
      placement (placing an instrument on the cervix to stabilize it), uterine sounding (measuring
      of the uterus) and at speculum removal; these are standard procedures during IUD insertion.
      Secondary outcomes include provider assessment of the patient's pain, patient's level of
      satisfaction with the insertion, and whether any adverse events such as nausea/vomiting,
      fainting, or IUD insertion failure occurred.

    <description>This secondary analysis looked at provider perception of patient maximum pain during IUD insertion This was not done per intervention because we were looking at the accuracy of the provider's assesment of the patient's pain, which is not dependent on intervention. The provider was blinded to the intervention so that would not have influenced results.</description>

    <description>Participants, after informed consent, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the inert gel group or the intervention group. In the intervention group, after tenaculum placement, a Q-tip soaked in approximately 1mL of 2% lidocaine gel will be placed in the cervix up to the level of the internal cervical os. The Q-tip will be held there for 1 minute and then be removed. We will repeat the same procedure in the control group with an inert gel similar in appearance, color and consistency to the lidocaine gel.
Both the patient and the provider will be blinded to which gel was received. The research assistant will place the gel from its labeled tube into the unlabeled sterile tube in another room.</description>

2% lidocaine gel: Participants, after informed consent, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the inert gel group or the intervention group.
