  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial evaluates the clinical outcomes associated with the non-invasive
      treatment to obtain lift and tightening of the cheek tissue and improve jawline definition
      and submental skin laxity utilizing the Ulthera™ System which delivers ultrasound energy in
      a focused manner below the surface of the skin
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ulthera™
      System for the non-invasive dermatological treatment to obtain lift and tighten the cheek
      tissue.

      The secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ulthera™
      System for the non-invasive dermatological treatment for improvement in jawline definition
      and submental skin laxity at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline based on the consensus of
      the three masked reviewers.

            <title>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</title>
            <description>Subjects indicated whether they saw improvement, i.e., providing a Yes/No response, in face and neck characteristics at three months (D90) post Ulthera treatment. Pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photographs were available for viewing during the assessment. Subjects also had a mirror in hand for real time assessment. Subjects' Yes/No responses were tabulated.</description>
