    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia and North America. The aim of this trial is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) once daily in insulin-naïve
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when using two different titration algorithms (dose
      individually adjusted) as add-on to subject's ongoing treatment with metformin.

    <description>Corresponds to rate of AEs per 100 patient years of exposure. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable.

Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed clinically) for 24 weeks or longer prior to randomisation

             alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) - all with unchanged dosing
             for at least 12 weeks prior to randomisation (visit 2). Metformin dose, alone or in
             combination (including fixed combination), must be at least 1000 mg daily

Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>
