  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, sequential study with two
      treatment groups differing only in the technique used for EXPAREL administration
      (instillation or infiltration).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject underwent bilateral augmentation mammoplasty and received the same dose of
      EXPAREL. This primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of EXPAREL when
      administered via infiltration versus instillation as part of bilateral augmentation
      mammoplasty. The secondary objectives were to further assess other efficacy measures and the
      safety profile of EXPAREL.
