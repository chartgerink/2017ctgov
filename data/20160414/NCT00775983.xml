  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded clinical trial comparing overnight laminaria versus same-day
      Dilapan for cervical preparation for surgical abortions occurring between fourteen and
      eighteen weeks gestation. Comparisons will be made between procedure time, need for
      additional dilation, occurrence of complications, and patient and provider satisfaction.

      Hypothesis:

      Cervical preparation for surgical abortion, between fourteen and eighteen weeks gestation,
      with same-day Dilapan is non-inferior to cervical preparation with overnight laminaria
      within a five-minute difference.

      Primary objective:

      Determine differences in procedure times

      Secondary objectives:

      Examine complications, and need for additional dilation between early second-trimester
      surgical abortions performed after cervical preparation with same-day Dilapan versus those
      performed after cervical preparation with overnight laminaria

            <description>For patients between 14 0/7 and 15 6/7 weeks' gestation on the day of the abortion, 2-3 Dilapan-S were inserted. For patients between 16 0/7 and 18 0/7 weeks' gestation, 2-5 Dilapan-S were inserted. One medium laminaria was placed along with the Dilapan-S because of the theory that the laminaria would facilitate the removal of Dilapan-S before the abortion. Patients then waited four to six hours for their abortion.</description>
