    <description>A subject seroconverted for HI antibodies against the H5N1 A/Indonesia virus strain (A/INDO) was defined as a vaccinee with either a pre-vaccination titer less than (&lt;) 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer higher than or equal to (&gt;=) 1:40, or with a pre-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
As the analyses were performed and disclosed stepwise - i.e. as soon as a study phase was completed - several releases of the CTRS (result summaries) were published. To generate an integrated Clinical Study Report, one set of domain datasets covering all analyses was used and the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity has been defined. As a consequence, some of the data previously disclosed and based on ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Day 42, Day 182 and Day 385 have been replaced in this summary with data generated with the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study included a first 385-days Blinded Phase (all subjects), followed by a 385-days Unblinded Phase. In this phase, subjects who received the placebo in the Blinded Phase were offered, after completing the Blinded Phase, 2 doses of Influenza A (H5N1) Virus monovalent vaccine administered for Dose 1 within a short delay of Day 385 (Day U0).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 842 subjects were enrolled in the study in its Blinded Phase part. This number was later amended down to 838, following corrections for wrong subject number allocation and randomization errors.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A subject seroconverted for HI antibodies against the H5N1 A/Indonesia virus strain (A/INDO) was defined as a vaccinee with either a pre-vaccination titer less than (&lt;) 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer higher than or equal to (&gt;=) 1:40, or with a pre-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
As the analyses were performed and disclosed stepwise – i.e. as soon as a study phase was completed – several releases of the CTRS (result summaries) were published. To generate an integrated Clinical Study Report, one set of domain datasets covering all analyses was used and the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity has been defined. As a consequence, some of the data previously disclosed and based on ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Day 42, Day 182 and Day 385 have been replaced in this summary with data generated with the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity.</description>

            <description>HI antibody titers against the H5N1 A/Indonesia virus strain (A/INDO) were expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The cut-off of the assay was the seropositivity cut-off of higher than or equal to (&gt;=) 1:10.
As the analyses were performed and disclosed stepwise – i.e. as soon as a study phase was completed – several releases of the CTRS (result summaries) were published. To generate an integrated Clinical Study Report, one set of domain datasets covering all analyses was used and the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity has been defined. As a consequence, some of the data previously disclosed and based on ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Day 42, Day 182 and Day 385 have been replaced in this summary with data generated with the Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity.</description>

            <description>Subjects in this group were those who were administered the saline placebo solution in the Blinded Phase of the study (either in the Placebo 6-&lt;36M, Placebo 3-&lt;9Y or Placebo 9-&lt;18Y Group). These were subjects aged at enrolment between 6 months and 18 years, 18 years excluded, who had received 2 doses of saline placebo at Days 0 and 21 in the Blinded Phase of the study, as per described in the descriptions of the Placebo 6-&lt;36M, Placebo 3-&lt;9Y and Placebo 9-&lt;18Y groups. After consenting to participating to the Unblinded Phase of the study, these subjects received in addition 2 doses of Influenza A (H5N1) Virus monovalent vaccine at Days 385 (Day U0) and Day 385 + 21 days (Day U21). Influenza A (H5N1) Virus monovalent vaccine was administered intramuscularly. Dose 1 was administered in the deltoid region of the non–dominant arm and Dose 2 in the deltoid region of the dominant arm.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects at Least 6 Years of Age Reporting Solicited General Symptoms.</title>
        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed in subjects of at least 6 years of age were fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, joint pain at other location, muscle aches, shivering, sweating and fever [axillary temperature (T) &gt;= 38.0 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diaorrhea and/or abdominal pain. “Any” was defined as any occurrence of the specified solicited general symptom reported, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 was defined as a general symptom that prevented normal activity. Related was defined as a general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination. Grade 3 fever was axillary temperature &gt;= 39.0°C.</description>

After consenting to participating to the Unblinded Phase of the study, these subjects received in addition 2 doses of Influenza A (H5N1) Virus monovalent vaccine at Days 385 (Day U0) and Day 385 + 21 days (Day U21). Influenza A (H5N1) Virus monovalent vaccine was administered intramuscularly. Dose 1 was administered in the deltoid region of the non–dominant arm and Dose 2 in the deltoid region of the dominant arm.</description>
