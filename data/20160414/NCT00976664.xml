  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the change in perceived levels of pain
      and dysfunction in 50 patients with chronic low back pain, following the use of custom-made
      shoe orthotics for a three month period. The hypothesis of this study is that custom
      orthotic intervention will improve the patients' low back pain and dysfunction symptoms.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females must be at least 18 years old.

          2. Subjects must be symptomatic with current pain between T12 and the Sacroiliac joints
             with or without radiating pain.

          3. Symptoms must have been present for at least three months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of custom-made shoe orthotics in the past year

          2. Brain disorders (i.e.: dementia or Alzheimer's Disease) that would lead to difficulty
             in questionnaire completion.

          3. Active conservative care (such as physical therapy or chiropractic care) for the low
             back received in the last six months (excluding the use of oral medications or daily
             at-home exercises for general well-being). We do not want to over-treat the patient
             or have any cross-over effects within this study from previous treatment.

          4. Not fluent or literate in the English language. We will not be able to provide
             multiple translators within this pilot study.

          5. Current or future litigation for low back pain.

          6. Chronic pain other then low back pain such as fibromyalgia

          7. Low back surgery in last six months.

          8. Other conditions that may affect the outcomes of this study or exclude patients from
             participation in the study, including contraindications to orthotic use.

          9. Peripheral neuropathy due to disorders such as diabetes.

         10. Low back or leg pain that is not reproducible.

      <pre_assignment_details>143 people were screened by phone, eligible patients (58) attended a baseline visit. Subjects were eligible if they were 18+ years of age and symptomatic with pain between T12-S1 joints with or without radiating pain for at least 3 months. Patients were randomized to a treatment group receiving custom-made orthotics or a wait-list control group.</pre_assignment_details>

            <title>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</title>
            <description>This index measures the functional disability of the subject, points on this index can range from 0-50. A higher numeric value on this scale indicates a worse outcome or increased disability (e.g. 0-10: minimal disability; 11-20: moderate disability; 21-30: severe disability; 31-50: crippling). Absolute scores are reported in the data table.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Subjects and clinicians were not blind to group. Subjects came from 1 region of the US, majority were white and ~50 years old. One type of orthotic was used as the only form of care. Several subjects felt discomfort/stiffness rather than pain.</limitations_and_caveats>
