  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, Japan and South America. The aim of the trial is to
      compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NN1250 (insulin degludec ([Deg]) with
      insulin detemir (IDet), both combined with insulin aspart.

      The main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN1250-3585 while the extension
      period is registered as NN1250-3725.

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 55 sites in 7 countries: Brazil (2), Finland (8), India (10), Italy (6), Japan (15), Macedonia (1) and United Kingdom (13). For the extension trial, one trial site in Italy did not enroll any subject since approval was not obtained before the start of the trial from the IEC.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects who completed the 26-week main trial (NN1250-3585, NCT01074268) and were found to be eligible for the extension trial were offered to participate in the 26-week extension trial (NN1250-3725). The total duration of treatment was 52 weeks (26 weeks + 26 weeks), separated by 1 week of follow-up from the main trial.</pre_assignment_details>

Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical issues</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 52 + 7 days follow up</time_frame>

        <population>The SAS included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or its comparator in the main trial including subjects carried through to the extension trial.</population>
