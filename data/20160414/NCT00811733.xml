  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the tolerability and efficacy of ofatumumab in follicular lymphoma and Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia, and the need to improve therapy for patients with WM utilizing a
      non-myelosuppressive agent this phase II trial of ofatumumab is being initiated in patients
      with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

Progression for PR/MR is either a &gt;=25% increase in IgM from the lowest attained response value or progression of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or other clinically significant signs/symptoms caused by WM.</description>

AEs were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Therapy, National Cancer Institute. Grades: 0 = No AE or within normal limits; 1 = Mild AE; 2 = Moderate AE; 3 = Severe and undesirable AE; 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; 5 = Death related to AE.</description>
