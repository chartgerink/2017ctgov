  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an evaluation of the Ulthera® System used to treat the upper arms for
      improvement of brachial ptosis. All enrolled subjects will receive one bilateral upper arm
      treatment. Follow-up visits will occur at 60, 90 and 180 days post-treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial treating up to 35 subjects. Study
      photographs of the upper arms will be taken prior to treatment, immediately post-treatment,
      and at each follow-up visit. Brachial volume and dermal thickness measurements will be
      obtained.
