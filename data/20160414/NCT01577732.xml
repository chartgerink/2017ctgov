    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of
      Infanrix-IPV+Hib™ when administered to healthy Vietnamese toddlers at 12 to 24 months of age
      who were vaccinated previously against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis diseases within
      their first six months of lives.

            <description>An unsolicited AE was any AE (i.e. any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any = occurrence of an AE regardless of intensity grade or relationship to study vaccination.</description>
