      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      bevacizumab together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib
      works in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that did not respond to
      previous treatment with gemcitabine.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the 6-month overall survival rate in patients with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with bevacizumab and
           erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the objective response rate in these patients.

        -  Evaluate time to tumor progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of the proportion of patients with ≥
           50% decline in carbohydrate antigen 19-9, also called cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)
           biomarker, in these patients.

        -  Obtain sequential measurements of circulating tumor cells (micrometastases) and
           endothelial cells in serum and correlate these variables with clinical outcomes (in
           patients enrolled in UCSF site only).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride
      once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      biomarker/laboratory analysis, including the CA19-9 biomarker. Circulating tumor
      micrometastases and endothelial cells are also measured in patients enrolled in University
      of California San Francisco (UCSF) site.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Time to tumor progression (TTP) was defined as the time from initial therapy to the first objective documentation of tumor progression (for patients with measurable disease) or to the data of death, if death was ascribed to progression of disease. Patients initially without measurable disease were included in the analysis based either on the appearance of new measurable lesions or on strongly suggestive radiographic evidence of progression of non-measurable disease). Participants were followed for tumor progression; the longest duration without progression was 132 days.</description>

        <description>Time to tumor progression (TTP) was defined as the time from initial therapy to the first objective documentation of tumor progression (for patients with measurable disease) or to the data of death, if death was ascribed to progression of disease. Patients initially without measurable disease were included in the analysis based either on the appearance of new measurable lesions or on strongly suggestive radiographic evidence of progression of non-measurable disease). Participants were followed for tumor progression; the longest duration without progression was 132 days.</description>
