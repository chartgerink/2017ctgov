  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We proposed to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effect of the
      use of a commercially-available chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch) as part of
      central venous catheter care on catheter-related bloodstream infections among patients in
      two Barnes-Jewish Hospital ICUs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of the inception of this study, there were no published randomized controlled
      trial on the efficacy of the Biopatch in reducing bloodstream infections. Preliminary data
      has shown that the Biopatch decreases colonization of the catheter exit site and thereby
      decrease bloodstream infections but this was at that time only theoretical.

Catheter dressing changes will only be done every 7 days unless there is visible blood, soiling underneath the dressing, or if the dressing comes off.</description>
