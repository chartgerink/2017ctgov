  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of selected doses and dose intervals of the novel long acting beta
      agonist (LABA), GW642444 in asthmatic subjects ≥18 years of age who are currently receiving
      inhaled corticosteroid treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a five-period cross-over study with each 7 day treatment period separated
      by a 7 day wash-out period. The study will enroll asthmatic subjects ≥18 years of age who
      are currently receiving inhaled corticosteroid treatment with an FEV1 of between 40-85% of
      predicted normal and with airway reversibility as demonstrated by an increase in FEV1 of
      ≥12% and ≥200ml .

      Efficacy assessments include 24-hour serial lung function testing. Safety assessments
      include incidence of adverse events and measurement of vital signs.

    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at the last two scheduled time points at the Day 7 clinic visit (i.e., 11 and 12 hours after the morning dose, or 23 and 24 hours after the evening dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 7 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with fixed effects of treatment, period, sex, and age. Participants is fitted as a random effect, and the period Baseline measurement is included as part of a bivariate response. The model for the period Baseline value is not affected by treatment group.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Weighted mean was derived by calculating the average area under curve, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. 24-hour serial measurements of FEV1 were performed on Day 7 of each of the 5 treatment periods (Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). Measurements were taken at pre-dose; 30 and 60 minutes; and 3, 5, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 15, 17, 23, and 24 hours post-dose. Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 were overnight visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 7 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with fixed effects for treatment, period, sex, and age. Participant was fitted as a random effect, and the period Baseline FEV1 measurement was included as part of a bivariate response. The model for the period Baseline value is not affected by treatment group.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants (par,) who met all inclusion criteria at screening entered a 7-day Run-in Period (RIP). Par. were instructed to administer albuterol inhalation aerosol as needed and to continue their inhaled corticosteroid at a stable dose throughout the study. Par. who met randomization criteria at the end of the RIP entered Treatment Period 1.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, five-period cross-over study. Following the 7(+7)-day RIP, eligible participants were randomized to 1 of 5 sequences of GW642444 at doses of 6.25 micrograms (µg) once daily (QD), 6.25 µg twice daily, 12.5 µg QD, 25 µg QD, and placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants received all treatments from a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) for 7 days. The treatments were administered approximately 12 hours apart. All participants took blinded treatment (active or placebo) every 12 hours, and therefore followed a 12-hour dosing interval. The five treatment periods were separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.</description>

          <description>All participants received one of the following five treatments in one of the five Treatment Periods from two DPI dispensed on Day 1of each of the five 7-day treatment periods: Placebo (PB), GW642444 6.25 µg once daily (QD) in the evening, GW642444 6.25 µg twice daily (BID), GW642444 12.5 µg QD in the evening, and GW642444 25 µg QD in the evening. Participants received their first evening medication dose in the clinic on Day 1 of each of the five treatment periods. The treatments were administered in the morning (AM) and in the evening (PM), approximately 12 hours apart. All participants took blinded treatment (active or placebo) every 12 hours, and therefore followed a 12-hour dosing interval. The five treatment periods were separated by a 7-day washout period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) FEV1 on Day 7 of the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at the last two scheduled time points at the Day 7 clinic visit (i.e., 11 and 12 hours after the morning dose, or 23 and 24 hours after the evening dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 7 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with fixed effects of treatment, period, sex, and age. Participants is fitted as a random effect, and the period Baseline measurement is included as part of a bivariate response. The model for the period Baseline value is not affected by treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean 24-hour FEV1 on Day 7 of the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Weighted mean was derived by calculating the average area under curve, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. 24-hour serial measurements of FEV1 were performed on Day 7 of each of the 5 treatment periods (Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). Measurements were taken at pre-dose; 30 and 60 minutes; and 3, 5, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 15, 17, 23, and 24 hours post-dose. Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 were overnight visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 7 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with fixed effects for treatment, period, sex, and age. Participant was fitted as a random effect, and the period Baseline FEV1 measurement was included as part of a bivariate response.

          <description>Participants received 2 actuations per day (AM and PM) during one of the five 7-day Treatment Periods from two seperate DPIs starting with their first dose on the evening of Day 1. Participants received one actuation of GW642444 25 µg and another actuation of placebo. The treatments were administered approximately 12 hours apart. All participants took blinded treatment (active or placebo) every 12 hours, and therefore followed a 12-hour dosing interval. Each treatment period was followed by a 7-day washout period.</description>
