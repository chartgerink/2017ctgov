      The purpose of this study is to determine if Pneumovax™ 23 (V110) is safe and immunogenic in
      participants from the Russian population who are 50 years of age and older or 2 to 49 years
      of age and at increased risk for pneumococcal disease

    <description>An adverse experience (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, is also an AE. Injection-site or systemic AEs that occurred in &gt;=4 participants were reported for this endpoint.</description>

    <description>A serious AE (SAE) is an AE that 1) results in death, 2) is life threatening, 3) results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 4) results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization, 5) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 6) is a cancer, 7) is an overdose, or 8) is another important medical event which, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention</description>
