  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation is a major concern in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. The
      patients may experience the sense of suffocation during emergence due to nasotracheal
      intubation and orofacial edema. Postoperative pain is also associated with emergence
      agitation. Although there is a lot of studies about emergence agitation in children, there
      is a few in adults, furthermore, no data about comparison of emergence agitation between
      sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia in adults. Therefore, the investigators would like to
      compare the incidence and severity of emergence agitation between sevoflurane and desflurane
      anesthesia in adults after orthognathic surgery.
