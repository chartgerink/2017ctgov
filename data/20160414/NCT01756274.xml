    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of three Bayer Blood Glucose
      Monitoring Systems (BGMS) with neonatal blood. Blood samples used in this study were
      'left-over samples'. The blood samples were from heel sticks of neonates, collected (into a
      tube) and sent to the laboratory. All meter Blood Glucose (BG) results were compared with
      capillary plasma results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method (Cobas® 6000
      instrument).

    <description>To evaluate the effect of neonatal age on the meter systems' performances, the number of blood samples that produced unusual meter results out of the total number of blood samples that came from babies less than 24 hours old was reported. Studentized residuals were used to measure the degree to which meter BG results departed from what would be expected using a linear model. (This analysis is not related to BGM accuracy status, which has already been reported.)</description>

        <title>Number of Blood Samples From Babies Less Than 24 Hours Old That Produced Meter Results Beyond What Random Chance Would Predict (i.e. Outside 95% Limits for Studentized Residuals)</title>
        <description>To evaluate the effect of neonatal age on the meter systems' performances, the number of blood samples that produced unusual meter results out of the total number of blood samples that came from babies less than 24 hours old was reported. Studentized residuals were used to measure the degree to which meter BG results departed from what would be expected using a linear model. (This analysis is not related to BGM accuracy status, which has already been reported.)</description>
