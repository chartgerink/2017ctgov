  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one Ulthera® treatment on
      the face and neck. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment. Study
      images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at each follow-up
      visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, single-site, double-blinded, randomized, split-face design.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups, receiving treatment using
      different energy levels. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores and patient satisfaction
      questionnaires will be obtained.

    <measure>Subjects' Assessment of Pain During Treatment With Lower Energy Settings</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for the duration of study treatment, an average of 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (NRS,0-10), for each anatomical region treated and energy settings used, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible.
Pain scores were collected in a consistent manner, following treatment of each section of the face and neck on both sides (submental, submandibular, cheek, periorbital, infraorbital, and forehead), and for each transducer used. Split-face comparisons of pain scores obtained during study treatment by research staff blinded to the energy settings used were completed.</description>

    <measure>Overall Improvement in Skin Laxity on the Face and Neck</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A split-face comparison of improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin was completed by three masked assessors. Pre-treatment and 90 days post-treatment photos from 45 subjects who returned for their 90-day follow-up visit were reviewed, assessing for improvement in skin laxity, i.e., lifted and tightened skin in the areas treated using treatment energy settings based on subjects' assigned study group.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Assessment of Brow Lift at 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Quantitative assessment and analysis of brow lift from baseline to 90 days post-treatment was completed comparing brow lift achieved using standard energy settings compared to adjusted energy settings. The number of subjects with 1 mm or more brow lift is reported. Note: Because the submental region was treated using standard energy settings in all study groups, a quantitative analysis of lift in this region between the study groups would most likely not be informative, and therefore was not completed.</description>

    <description>Subjects completed a Patient Assessment Questionnaire at 90 days post-treatment by referring to their image in a mirror, their 90-day post-treatment photos, and their pre-treatment photos, and reporting if any improvement was noted on the right and left sides of their face and neck.</description>

        <title>Subjects' Assessment of Pain During Treatment With Lower Energy Settings</title>
        <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (NRS,0-10), for each anatomical region treated and energy settings used, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible.
Pain scores were collected in a consistent manner, following treatment of each section of the face and neck on both sides (submental, submandibular, cheek, periorbital, infraorbital, and forehead), and for each transducer used. Split-face comparisons of pain scores obtained during study treatment by research staff blinded to the energy settings used were completed.</description>

            <title>Group C</title>
            <description>Subjects received a standard Ultherapy® treatment using the (standard) highest energy settings on both sides of the lower face and neck. On the upper face (brow), the 4-4.5mm transducer was used at the (adjusted)second highest energy setting on one side of the upper face, and the 7-4.5mm transducer at the (standard) highest energy setting on the contralateral side of the upper face. For Group C, the standard energy side is defined as the upper face side treated with the 7-4.5mm transducer at the highest energy setting and the corresponding lower face side; the adjusted energy side is defined as the upper face side treated with 4-4.5mm transducer at the second highest energy setting and the corresponding lower face side.</description>
