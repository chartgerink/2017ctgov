    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater the recovery from neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.
Analysis of recovery in Chinese subjects was the primary objective; Caucasian subjects and between-group analyses were secondary.</description>
