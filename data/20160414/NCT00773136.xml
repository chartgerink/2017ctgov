      Objective: To determine if Lumigan (bimatoprost) causes increased lash length when used in
      gel suspension applied to the base of the eyelashes. Methods: Subjects recruited from the
      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute were screened and those who met inclusion criteria were
      enrolled. Each participant received two vials of gel suspension, which contained bimatoprost
      and normal saline, respectively, each mixed 1:1 with GonakTM gel and labeled &quot;right eye&quot; and
      &quot;left eye&quot; according to randomization. The suspension was applied to the eyelashes every
      evening on the designated eye for 6 weeks. Lash length was measured with a caliper at
      enrollment, at weekly intervals during the study and at 1 and 3 months after study
      completion. Visual acuity, ocular symptoms, intraocular pressure and photographs were
      documented at these same intervals. Results: The average eyelash growth in the Lumigan group
      was 2.01mm (vs. control average of 1.13mm) which was a statistically significant difference
      (p=0.009). The average intraocular pressure decreased equally in both groups (2.14 mmHg). No
      change in visual acuity or iris discoloration was noted in any of the subjects. Discussion:
      Our data showed an increase in eyelash length with use of Lumigan in gel suspension,
      suggesting that it may have eyelash lengthening properties.

Throughout the study, we used the same measuring technique, always measuring the length of the longest lash uncurled using a surgical caliper. Visual acuity, ocular symptoms, intraocular pressure and slit lamp exam were recorded at these same intervals.</description>
