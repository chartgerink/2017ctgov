    <textblock>
      A new multi-purpose solution (MPS)was clinically evaluated against Opti-Free RepleniSH MPS
      at specific time points over the course of four days. The study was conducted with
      PureVision lenses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  were at least 18 years old;

          -  were experienced contact lens wearers;

          -  were correctable to at least 20/40 or better in both eyes with contact lenses;

          -  were in good general health, with healthy eyes (other than requiring vision
             correction);

          -  had not worn lenses for at least 12 hours before each baseline visit;

          -  had a corneal staining score no greater than Grade 1 in either eye at time of
             enrollment;

          -  had previously used an MPS or hydrogen peroxide solution successfully.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  had a confirmed diagnosis of Sj√∂gren's syndrome or other condition that results in a
             chronic and/or pathologic dry eye condition;

          -  required concurrent ocular medication or have used ocular medication within 24 hours
             of entering the study;

          -  had a known sensitivity or intolerance to any MPS, study products or ingredient(s);

          -  were currently participating in any other clinical study;

          -  had a condition or are in a situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put
             them at significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with
             their participation in the study.

      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to baseline visit subjects were instructed to undergo a &quot;washout period&quot; where no contacts were worn for 12 hours. Slit lamp exam was conducted prior to randomized group assignment. Eyes were thoroughly rinsed with unit-dose aline before pre-soaked study lenses were inserted.</pre_assignment_details>
