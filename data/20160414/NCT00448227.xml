Badly but accepted: infant showed displeasure with dosing but could be coaxed to take complete dose
Neither good nor bad: infant showed no apparent displeasure and with little effort was coaxed to take complete dose
Well accepted: infant appeared to enjoy the formulation and with little coaxing ingested most of dose
Very well accepted: infant appeared eager and ingested most of dose without special coaxing</description>

        <description>Assessed by the study personnel using a 5-point scale after dosing:
Very badly accepted/unacceptable: infant showed great displeasure, compromising use of formulation
Badly but accepted: infant showed displeasure with dosing but could be coaxed to take complete dose
Neither good nor bad: infant showed no apparent displeasure and with little effort was coaxed to take complete dose
Well accepted: infant appeared to enjoy the formulation and with little coaxing ingested most of dose
Very well accepted: infant appeared eager and ingested most of dose without special coaxing</description>
