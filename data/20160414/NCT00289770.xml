  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis A and B
      antibodies at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after subjects received their first dose of a 3
      dose primary vaccination schedule of combined hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at
      Year 11-15.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after primary vaccination
      with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine (three-dose schedule with 3 different
      lots). To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will be bled at Years 11,
      12, 13, 14 and 15 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to
      determine their anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

      No additional subjects will be recruited in the course of this extension study. If a subject
      has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies or lost anti-HBs seroprotection
      concentrations at the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15),
      he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose.

    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cut-off value was defined as 15 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). This was considered as seropositivity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Anti-hepatitis B Surface Antigen (Anti-HBs) Antibody Concentrations Equal to or Above Cut-off Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cut-off values were defined 3.3 mIU/mL for the in-house anti-HBs assay and 6.2 mIU/mL for the ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay, which was also considered as seropositivity, and 10 mIU/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Concentrations are expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in mIU/mL.
The laboratory assay was changed from Year 13 to Year 14 to in-house ELISA and at Year 15 to CLIA for anti-HBs GMCs.Thus for the sake of bridging, blood samples corresponding to Year 14 previously tested with ELISA were re-tested with CLIA (Year 14*).</description>

    <time_frame>at Year 11, pre-additional vaccine, after additional dose of Engerix</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects who lost seroprotective concentrations for anti-HBs (&lt; 10 mIU/mL) at any of the LT follow-up timepoints received an additional dose of Engerix after year 15.
Two subjects were eligible for this after Year 11.
3.29 in the table means a concentration of &lt; 3.3 mIU/mL.
As the concentration was calculated per subject no mean concentration was calculated and also no measure of dispersion.</description>

    <description>Anamnestic response was assessed in subjects receiving an additional vaccine dose of Engerix. Two subjects were found eligible at Year 11 for this additional vaccine dose.
Anamnestic response was defined as:
post-additional vaccination anti-HBs concentration &gt;= 10 mIU/mL in subject seronegative before additional dose.
4-fold increase post-additional dose compared to pre-additional vaccine time point.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects, Receiving an Additional Vaccination of Engerix, With an Anamnestic Response</title>
        <description>Anamnestic response was assessed in subjects receiving an additional vaccine dose of Engerix. Two subjects were found eligible at Year 11 for this additional vaccine dose.
Anamnestic response was defined as:
post-additional vaccination anti-HBs concentration &gt;= 10 mIU/mL in subject seronegative before additional dose.
4-fold increase post-additional dose compared to pre-additional vaccine time point.</description>
        <time_frame>30 days post additional dose of Engerix</time_frame>
        <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the long-term (LT) Total Vaccinated Cohort in subjects who were eligible for an additional dose. This included all subjects who had received at least one dose of the study vaccine in the primary study and who returned for the blood sampling timepoint and who had serology results for anti-HAV and anti-HBs available.</population>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following complete retesting and reanalysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
