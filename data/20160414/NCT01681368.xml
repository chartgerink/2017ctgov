      Background:

      - Birinapant is an experimental cancer treatment drug. It removes certain proteins in cells,
      which helps to kill the cells. The drug is more likely to cause the death of cancer cells
      than normal cells because cancer cells have more of these proteins. Studies suggest that it
      can help treat ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.
      Researchers want to see how well Birinapant works against the three types of cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the effectiveness of Birinapant for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Women at least 18 years of age who have ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
      cancer that has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will also be collected. Tumor tissue samples may be collected before treatment.
           Imaging studies will also be performed.

        -  Participants will have an infusion of Birinapant once per week for 3 weeks in a row,
           followed by a break for a week on the fourth week. This 4-week schedule is one cycle of
           treatment.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Another optional tumor biopsy will be collected 6 weeks after the start of treatment.

        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects are
           not severe.

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer in women (excluding skin cancer). It
           ranks fifth as the cause of cancer death in women. In the United States, 21,550 new
           cases and 14,600 deaths are estimated annually.

        -  Approximately 90% of primary malignant ovarian tumors are epithelial (carcinomas).

        -  Although over 70% of women with advanced disease respond to optimal debulking surgery
           followed by platinum-taxane based chemotherapy, duration of response is short and
           relapse is common. Subsequent responses to salvage therapy regimens tend to be brief
           (less than six months) due to the tumors progressive resistance to chemotherapy(1).

        -  A family of proteins, known as the Inhibitors of Apoptotic Proteins (or IAPs), plays a
           critical role in blocking the apoptotic signals at multiple points. IAPs regulate a
           number of pathways including classical or alternative nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-(K)B)
           function, and activation of apoptosis through either the extrinsic or intrinsic
           pathway. Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 1 (cIAP1) acts as a critical switch
           to promote the pro-survival nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) pathway and prevent caspase
           activation.

        -  In normal cells that are stimulated to undergo apoptosis by either the extrinsic or
           intrinsic pathway, second mitochondrial-derived activation of caspares (SMAC) is
           released from the mitochondria, which antagonizes IAP, removes blockade to activated
           caspase function, and thereby enables apoptotic cell death. In tumor cells, however,
           apoptosis is dysregulated due to insufficient amounts of SMAC or upstream blockades to
           apoptotic activation.

        -  Classical activation of NF-(K)B is dependent on the presence of cIAP1 and cIAP2
           proteins as part of the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) complex. SMAC inhibits
           cIAP1 and cIAP2, leading to inactivation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)
           mediated NF- B activation. SMAC inhibition of cIAP1 and cIAP2 leads to pathway
           up-regulation. Birinapant (TL32711) is a synthetic peptidomimetic antagonist of IAPs (a
           SMAC-mimetic), which mimics endogenous SMAC resulting in the rapid and irreversible
           initiation of apoptotic cell death. SMAC-mimetics represent a novel targeted
           therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. The addition of a SMAC mimetic, can inhibit
           NF- B activity, down-regulate cell survival pathways, and overcome blockades to the
           apoptotic pathway leading to increased tumor cell death.

        -  Our laboratory has demonstrated that serous ovarian cancers have cell-autonomous
           activation of NF-B signaling which was shown to correlate with poor prognosis.

        -  Therefore, we hypothesize that the SMAC-mimetic activity of birinapant may be
           selectively toxic to those ovarian cancers that display high canonical NF-(K)B
           activity.

        -  To summarize, relapsed platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer is a disease
           with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Birinapant offers the opportunity
           to develop an effective and well tolerated therapeutic for the significant unmet need.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  The primary objective is to determine the efficacy as defined by Gynecologic Oncology
           Group (GOG) criteria2 as either objective response or progession-free survival lasting
           greater than 6 months, in patients with relapsed platinum refractory or resistant
           ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, fallopian tube cancer treated with
           birinapant.

        -  The seconday objectives include overall survival, safety and tolerability of single
           agent birinapant in this population.

      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        -  Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age with histologically proven advanced
           metastatic or unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer that is relapsed or refractory to
           prior platinum-based standard care systemic regimen.

        -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2.

        -  Adequate organ functionas defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.

      Design:

        -  This is an open label, non-randomized phase II trial to determine the efficacy of
           administration of the SMAC-mimetic birinapant in patients with relapsed platinum
           refractory or resistant ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, fallopian tube
           cancer.

        -  Birinapant will be given as a single agent until disease progression once weekly for
           three weeks of 4 week intervals.

        -  The primary endpoint will be efficacy defined according to the GOG guidelines as
           overall response rate or progression-free survival lasting at least 6 months. Overall
           survival, toxicity and modulation of signal events in tumor are secondary measures.

        -  Patients will be evaluated at baseline and prior to each cycle by history and physical
           examination and every two cycles by examination and imaging studies (computed
           tomography (CT) scan). Laboratory studies will be performed weekly prior to each dose
           except on week 4 (rest week).

        -  Tumor biopsy will be performed prior to birinapant initiation and an optional tumor
           biopsy will be performed 2 to 48 hours after cycle 2 day 15 infusion.

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will also be harvested at the same time points as
           the biopsies.

        -  Reassessment imaging (computed tomography (CT) scan) to document response will be
           performed at the end of 2 cycles and every 2 cycles thereafter.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Study participants will be eligible for study participation if they are/have:

          -  Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event
             data are currently available on the use of birinapant in patients &lt; 18 years of age,
             children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric
             trials.

          -  Able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent, and are willing
             and able to comply with the protocol requirements including the requirement for
             biopsies for research purposes.

          -  Advanced metastatic or unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
             cancer or fallopian tube cancer that is relapsed and resistant or refractory to prior
             platinum-based standard care systemic regimen. Patients who are unable to receive
             further platinum, due to either allergic reaction or other medical reason, are
             eligible for the protocol. There is no limitation on the amount of prior therapies
             allowed.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from previous therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal
             therapy, and radiation therapy, immunotherapy and monoclonal antibodies, alternative
             therapy or investigational therapeutic agents). Patients who have had cranial
             radiation therapy need to have completed it greater than or equal to 8 weeks prior to
             commencing on study. Patients are permitted to receive investigational imaging agents
             while on study.

          -  Patients who have had major surgery must be fully recovered and require a recovery
             period of greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to enrolling on study.

          -  Histopathologic diagnosis must be confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology (LP),
             National Cancer Institute (NCI).

        A block of the primary tumor, or access to recut slides is preferred. If this is
        unavailable, a recent resection specimen of a metastatic site is required for entry. In
        addition, access to archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks will be
        requested to perform correlative studies. Study participants with the following histologic
        epithelial ovarian cancer cell types are eligible: Serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid
        adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell
        adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant
        Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S).

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for
             nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as
             greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam and a sentinel lesion adequate
             for core biopsy through percutaneous biopsy. See Section 13 for the evaluation of
             measurable disease.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             less than or equal to 2.

          -  Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X
             upper limit of normal (ULN), or measured creatinine clearance greater than or equal
             to 60 ml/min/1.73m^2.

          -  Adequate hepatic function, defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) levels less than or equal to 3 X ULN and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5
             X ULN, unless known diagnosis of Gilberts syndrome.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, defined as absolute neutrophil (ANC) greater than or
             equal to 1,500/mm^3 (greater than or equal to1.5 X10^6/L), platelet count greater
             than or equal to 75,000/mm^3 (greater than or equal to 75 X10^6/L), and hemoglobin
             greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL (transfusion to obtain hemoglobin greater than or
             equal to 10 mg/dL within 24 hours prior to dosing is allowed).

          -  Contraception is not a consideration as these patients have all had surgical removal
             of their reproductive organs. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             birinapant may have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with birinapant, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior
             to enrollment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Known or suspected diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus or chronic active
             hepatitis B or C. Viral testing is not required. The reason for exclusion is
             insufficient evidence demonstrating safety of administration of birinapant in
             patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C due to theoretical
             risk of unmasking or exacerbating these serious viral illnesses since birinapant may
             impair immunological function. Data are not currently available on risk of
             interaction with antiretroviral drugs. HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with birinapant. The potential immune suppressive effects and T-cell
             depletion associated with birinapant pose an additional increased risk to these
             patients. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          2. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring current treatment (&lt; 8 weeks
             from last cranial radiation or &lt; 4 weeks from last steroids). (Patients with abnormal
             clinical exam or history will require a head CT or MRI to rule out or confirm brain
             metastases).

          3. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease including the
             following:

               1. New York Heart Association grade III or IV congestive heart failure.

               2. Myocardial infarction within the last 12 months prior to dosing with birinapant.

               3. Subjects known to have impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
                  according to institutional standards must be excluded.

          4. Lack of recovery of prior adverse events to Grade less than or equal to1 severity
             (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]
             v 4.03) (except alopecia) due to therapy administered prior to the initiation of
             study drug dosing. Stable persistent grade 2 peripheral neuropathy may be allowed as
             determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Investigator as
             birinapant has not been shown to cause or exacerbate peripheral neuropathy.

          5. Known allergy to any of the formulation components of birinapant including citric
             acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dehydrate, and sodium chloride.

          6. Any concurrent disease and/or medical condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would prevent the subjects participation, render the subject at
             excessive risk or limit the subjects compliance with the protocols required
             evaluations.

          7. Patients with active infection will not be eligible, but may become eligible once
             infection has resolved and they are at least 7 days from completion of antibiotics.

          8. Another previous or current malignancy within the last 5 years, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ curatively treated, ductal or
             lobular carcinoma in situ curatively treated and without ongoing therapeutic
             intervention. Patients with breast cancer (BRCA) 1 or 2 mutation, who have had a
             previous diagnosis of breast cancer are eligible if the breast cancer was diagnosed 5
             years previously and distant or local recurrence of breast cancer has been outruled.

          9. Concomitant chronic (daily or almost daily for greater than or equal to1 month prior)
             use of steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Intermittent use
             of steroids as pre-medications is allowed. Based on research to date the tumor and
             tumor microenvironment production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha could promote
             anti-tumor activity. Theoretically, anti-inflammatories could blunt local production,
             limiting this possibly positive cofactor.

         10. No concomitant use of complementary or alternative medication or other agents
             (investigational therapeutic agents) will be allowed without approval of a principal
             investigator (PI) or associate investigator (AI). Every effort will be made to
             maximize patient safety and minimize changes in chronic medications.

         11. Patients with a recent history (within last 5 years) of autoimmune disease or
             inflammatory diseases will be excluded, for example, active rheumatoid
             arthritis,active inflammatory bowel disease or any chronic inflammatory conditions
             because birinapant synergizes with TNF in vitro.

        INCLUSION OF MINORITIES:

        Women from all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the
        eligibility criteria.

        To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or
        disease response would be expected in one group compared to another. Efforts will be made
        to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance
        must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of
        individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and
        the need to explore ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences
        in outcome that correlate to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a
        follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully. This study
        will be recruited through internal referral, our local physician referral base, and
        through Cancer Hotline information.
