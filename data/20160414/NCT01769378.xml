    <description>An additional intervention (rescue therapy) was defined as any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation.

            <title>Time to Initiation of Additional Intervention for Severe, Persistent Hyperglycemia</title>
            <description>An additional intervention (rescue therapy) was defined as any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation. Participants who had no rescue therapy within specified study period were considered as censored observations at the last available contact date up to specified study period.</description>
