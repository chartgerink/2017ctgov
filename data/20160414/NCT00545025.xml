            <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were ecchymosis, pain, redness and swelling at injection site. Any = incidence of a particular symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal everyday activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling/ecchymosis = redness/swelling/ecchymosis spreading beyond 50 millimeters (mm) of the injection site. All solicited local symptoms assessed were considered by the investigator as related to study vaccination.</description>
