    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania, Africa, Asia and South America. This trial is
      designed to show the effect of treatment with liraglutide when adding to existing metformin
      therapy and to compare it with the effects of metformin monotherapy and combination therapy
      of metformin and glimepiride. Two trial periods: A 6 month (26 weeks) randomised,
      double-blinded period followed by an 18 months open-label extension, in total 2 years (104
      weeks).

    <description>Change in mean prandial increments of plasma glucose based on self-measured 7-point plasma glucose profiles from baseline (week 0) to 26 weeks (end of randomisation). The 7 time points for self-measurements were: before each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner), at 90 min after start of each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and at bedtime.
Mean prandial increments of plasma glucose were calculated as the sum of the plasma glucose differences between values measured before and after a meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) divided by three.</description>

        <description>Change in mean prandial increments of plasma glucose based on self-measured 7-point plasma glucose profiles from baseline (week 0) to 26 weeks (end of randomisation). The 7 time points for self-measurements were: before each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner), at 90 min after start of each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and at bedtime.
Mean prandial increments of plasma glucose were calculated as the sum of the plasma glucose differences between values measured before and after a meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) divided by three.</description>

        <description>Change in mean prandial increments of plasma glucose based on self-measured 7-point plasma glucose profiles from baseline (week 0) to 104 weeks (end of treatment). The 7 time points for self-measurements were: before each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner), at 90 min after start of each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and at bedtime.
Mean prandial increments of plasma glucose were calculated as the sum of the plasma glucose differences between values measured before and after a meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) divided by three.</description>

        <title>Hypoglycaemic Episodes at Week 104</title>
        <description>Total number of hypoglycaemic episodes occuring after baseline (week 0) until 104 weeks (end of treatment). Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as major, minor, or symptoms only. Major if the subject was unable to treat her/himself. Minor if subject was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L. Symptoms only if subject was able to treat her/himself and with no plasma glucose measurement or plasma glucose higher than or equal to 3.1 mmol/L.</description>
