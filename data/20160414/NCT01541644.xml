    <textblock>
      Patients are asked to be in this study if they have multiple myeloma and are having
      tingling, numbness and pain from taking bortezomib (velcade®). Patients who have been
      diagnosed with multiple myeloma often take bortezomib (velcade®).

      This research is being done to find out if acupuncture can reduce the nerve pain, tingling,
      and/or numbness patients experience due to bortezomib (velcade®).

      Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the &quot;energy points&quot;
      on the body with the aim to restore health and well-being. It has been used widely to treat
      pain, such as lower back pain and nerve pain. In this study we will see if acupuncture can
      be used to ease nerve pain and tingling, numbness that is caused by bortezomib.

      Information gained from this clinical trial will provide insight into the efficacy and
      mechanism of acupuncture in reducing Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (BIPN) in
      multiple myeloma patients. It will examine the effect of acupuncture on serum
      proinflammatory cytokine and β-endorphin levels to further understand the mechanism of
      acupuncture on a molecular level. This study is the first clinical trial studying the effect
      of acupuncture on treating BIPN. It is also the first study to explore the mechanism of
      acupuncture through frequent small amount of blood draws at six time points to detect
      changes in proinflammatory cytokines and β-endorphins. It has the potential to identify a
      minimal risk non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate BIPN symptoms, and to
      significantly improve our understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Response is defined as the average change of Clinical Total Neuropathy Score (TNSc) greater than or equal to 10% over 10 weeks as compared to baseline. Effect is defined as as the average change of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity/ Gynecologic Oncology Group (FACT/GOG-Ntx)over 10 weeks as compared to baseline.
Safety will be assessed by recording side effects from acupuncture treatment. Please note TNSc results deemed invalid as original validation of TNSc was performed by 2 neuromuscular trained physicians &amp; the TNSc in our trial was performed by a research nurse. The reliability &amp; validity of research nurse's TNSc not established pre-trial.
For the scale range, the higher the score the worse the symptoms and function. No subscales were used.</description>
