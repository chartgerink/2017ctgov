    <description>Change from baseline after 2 weeks in responses to patient-completed diaries for reflective Total Nasal VMR Symptom Scores (rTVSS). TVSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, post nasal drip and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are totaled for a composite score (TVSS score), the maximum of which could be 12. Reflective scores were assessed from the hour since the last dose of study medication.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline after 2 weeks in responses to patient-completed diaries for reflective Total Nasal VMR Symptom Scores (rTVSS). TVSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, post nasal drip and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are totaled for a composite score (TVSS score), the maximum of which could be 12. Reflective scores were assessed from the hour since the last dose of study medication.</description>
