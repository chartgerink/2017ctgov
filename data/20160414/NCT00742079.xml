    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether pretreatment with D-cycloserine before cognitive behavioral
      therapy can reduce impairments still present in people with stable cases of schizophrenia as
      well as determine which traits make schizophrenics most likely to respond to D-cycloserine
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a debilitating chronic condition that affects approximately 1 % of
      Americans, who experience symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorders of
      thought and movement. These symptoms are described as positive symptoms, because they are
      experienced in addition to what healthy individuals experience. Negative symptoms, which are
      reductions in normal functioning, and cognitive deficits, which are problems in thinking,
      also plague people with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits
      associated with schizophrenia are produced in otherwise healthy people by neurotransmitters
      inhibiting the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors in the brain. This
      inhibition of NMDA receptors also causes intensification of psychotic symptoms in otherwise
      stabilized schizophrenic patients. The drug D-cycloserine partially excites NMDA receptors,
      and it has been used to help patients with anxiety disorders to overcome phobias while they
      are receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. This study will examine whether D-cycloserine
      can increase the cognitive flexibility of someone undergoing CBT and thereby enhance the
      therapy's ability to reduce a patient's belief in paranoid delusions, preoccupation with
      delusions, and related distress.

      All participants will be screened to ensure proper diagnosis of schizophrenia without other
      conditions. Those who pass will be randomly assigned to receive either D-cycloserine first
      or a placebo pill first. One week after the screening, participants in the D-cycloserine
      group will be given the drug before a 1-hour session of simulated CBT treatment. Those in
      the placebo condition will receive a placebo pill before an identical session. Two weeks
      after the screening, both groups will be called back for another session of CBT, but the
      pills they receive will be switched. Those who received D-cycloserine the first week will
      receive placebo, and those who received placebo will receive D-cycloserine. The CBT sessions
      will attempt to increase cognitive flexibility in patients by asking them to provide
      alternate explanations for common situations. At screening, at the start of visits on the
      first and second weeks, and at a follow-up visit on the third week, participants will
      undergo a series of assessments, including interviews, computerized tests, and self-report
      measures. Belief in, preoccupation with, and distress caused by delusions, as well as degree
      of cognitive flexibility, will be assessed.

    <description>Number of alternative beliefs generated on the Alternative Beliefs Assessment. This assessment used nine vignettes describing social interactions: three of neutral content, three negatively-valanced, and three tailored to the patient's specific delusions. Participants were asked to generate as many explanations (alternative beliefs) as they could for each scenario, and the number of explanations produced in response to each item was recorded. Scores could range from 0 to as many explanations a person could produce (no maximum value). The total score was calculated by adding all alternative beliefs generated from each vignette. A higher number of alternative beliefs generated reflects a greater degree of cognitive flexibility.</description>

        <title>Alternative Beliefs Assessment</title>
        <description>Number of alternative beliefs generated on the Alternative Beliefs Assessment. This assessment used nine vignettes describing social interactions: three of neutral content, three negatively-valanced, and three tailored to the patient's specific delusions. Participants were asked to generate as many explanations (alternative beliefs) as they could for each scenario, and the number of explanations produced in response to each item was recorded. Scores could range from 0 to as many explanations a person could produce (no maximum value). The total score was calculated by adding all alternative beliefs generated from each vignette. A higher number of alternative beliefs generated reflects a greater degree of cognitive flexibility.</description>
