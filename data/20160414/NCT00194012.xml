    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability/safety of
      aripiprazole (abilify) in children with subsyndromal symptoms of bipolar disorder who also
      have a bipolar parent and other family member with a mood disorder.

    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial
      that will last up to 12 weeks.

      This placebo-controlled portion will be followed by a 6-week open label
      extension/stabilization phase. In order to be eligible for participation in the
      extension/stabilization phase, subjects must: 1) in the investigator's opinion have had no
      dose-limiting side effects likely to be attributable to aripiprazole (APZ); 2) participated
      in the blinded portion of the clinical trial for a minimum of 4 weeks.

    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item o the YMRS is given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher being more severe mania.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited beginning 8/2004 with follow up interviews completed 5/2012. Families were recruited from an outpatient child/adolescent psychiatric research center and an adult mood disorders program at University Hospitals, Case Medical Center</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After screening and baseline assessments study participants were assigned to aripiprazole or placebo. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 0.1mg/kg/d. The dose could be increased by approximately 0.05 mg/kg/d at each study visit if patient experienced residual symptomology with no intolerable side effect to maximum dose 15mg/d. .</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Youth Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</title>
        <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items and is based on the patient’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item o the YMRS is given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher being more severe mania.</description>
