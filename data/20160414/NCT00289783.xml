  <brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Hib-MenCY-TT Vaccine Compared to Licensed Hib Conjugate Vaccine</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase III, Randomized, Multinational Study, Double-blinded for the Immunogenicity and Consistency Evaluation of 3 Hib-MenCY-TT Vaccine Lots and Single-blinded and Controlled for the Evaluation of Safety and Immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus Influenzae Type b and Neisseria Meningitidis Serogroups C and Y-tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine Combined (Hib-MenCY-TT) Compared to Monovalent Hib Vaccine in Healthy Infants at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 Months of Age.</official_title>

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the immunogenicity and consistency of 3 Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine lots and
      the safety and immunogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to a control group receiving
      licensed Hib conjugate vaccine, when each are co-administered with Pediarix® to healthy
      infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The study will also evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to a control group receiving licensed Hib
      conjugate vaccine, when each are co-administered with M-M-R® II and Varivax® at 12 to 15
      months of age.

      The subjects from this study will participate in one of three cohorts:

        -  US Safety and Immunogenicity (Cohort 1): All immunogenicity analyses in the primary and
           booster phases will be evaluated in this cohort. These subjects will also contribute to
           the safety analyses in the primary and booster phases.

        -  Safety Only (Cohort 2): Only safety objectives will be assessed in the primary and
           booster phases for this cohort.

        -  Non-US Safety and Immunogenicity (Cohort 3): Only descriptive immunogenicity results in
           the primary and booster phases will be reported for this cohort. These subjects will
           also contribute to the safety analyses in the primary and booster phases.

      Treatment allocation:

      Primary phase: Subjects will be randomized with balanced allocation (1:1:1:1) to 1 of the 4
      treatment groups and with a stratification according to the cohort. Assignment to a cohort
      will be based on study site.

      Booster phase: Subjects who received Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine in the primary phase will receive
      a booster dose of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine. Subjects who received ActHIB in the primary phase
      will receive a booster dose of PedvaxHIB.

      During the 3-dose primary vaccination course, co-administration of Prevnar, Synagis, and/or
      rotavirus vaccine is permitted; co-administration of influenza vaccine is permitted at dose
      3.

      During the booster vaccination, co-administration of Prevnar, hepatitis A vaccine and
      influenza vaccine is permitted for all subjects in Cohort 1, 2 and 3; and co-administration
      of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine is permitted for all subjects in Cohort 2
      and 3.

      The study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion with regard to consistency of the 3
      manufacturing lots of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine and single-blind fashion for Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine
      versus monovalent Hib vaccine. The parents/guardians will be blinded up to collection of all
      data pertaining to the period up to one month after booster vaccination. Therefore, the
      extended safety follow-up after the booster dose will be conducted in an unblinded manner.
      The person administering the vaccines will ensure that the parent/guardian does not see the
      vaccine vial used in reconstituting the vaccine. Due to the differences in the presentations
      of the candidate Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine and control vaccines, it is not possible to blind
      study personnel who administer the vaccines.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were randomized at the beginning of the primary phase and kept their group assignment during the fourth dose vaccination phase. The study protocol identified 3 different study cohorts : United States (US) Safety and Immunogenicity (Cohort 1), Safety Only (Cohort 2: from all investigation sites), Non-US Safety and Immunogenicity (Cohort 3).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The data for 261 subjects from one study center in the US were not included in the analyses as vaccine accountability could not be fully reconciled (i.e. treatment group assignment for the different subjects could not be verified).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Menhibrix Group</title>
          <description>Subjects were primed with 3 doses of Menhibrix vaccine Lot A, B or C co-administered with Pediarix and boosted with 1 dose of Menhibrix vaccine, with co-administration of M-M-R II and Varivax. Subjects received vaccination at approximately 2, 4, 6 months and the fourth dose at 12-15 months of age. Menhibrix and Pediarix vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the right or left upper thigh, respectively. M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines were administered subcutaneously respectively in the upper left arm and the upper right arm.</description>
