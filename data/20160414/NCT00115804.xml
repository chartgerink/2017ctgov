  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to conduct an open, pilot trial to assess the efficacy and
      safety of fluoxetine in the treatment of Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a common condition that is often challenging to treat. It is defined by the
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as widespread pain of at least 3 months duration in
      combination with tenderness at 11 or more of 18 specific tender point sites on the body. The
      prevalence of JPFS in children and adolescents in the general population of the United
      States is unknown. Studies from Israel, Mexico, and Italy have estimated that the prevalence
      rate of JPFS in school children ranges from 1.24% to 6.20%, with girls making up the
      majority of cases. Information from a national registry in the United States indicates that
      JPFS accounts for about 7.7% of new patient diagnoses in a pediatric rheumatology setting.
      The mean age of onset of pediatric JPFS is 12 years. As in adults, JPFS has been diagnosed
      in children and adolescents using the ACR criteria. JPFS often leads to substantial
      morbidity and disability. For example, adolescents with JPFS reported significantly greater
      functional disability and greater number of school absences than those with other rheumatic
      diseases such as juvenile RA or lupus. The presence of high levels of pain and disability at
      this critical developmental stage place adolescents with JPFS at greater risk for long term
      social and occupational difficulties. Early diagnosis and effective intervention are
      therefore of critical importance.
