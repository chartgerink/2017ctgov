    <time_frame>For this measure, outcome was assessed at baseline, the end of the first intervention (3 or 4 days post-implantation, depending on the subject), and the end of the second intervention (6 or 8 days post-implantation, depending on the subject).</time_frame>

    <description>Back pain intensity was measured on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (0=&quot;no pain&quot;, 10=&quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;) at baseline and following low rate and high rate stimulation. This outcome measure compared the change in intensity from baseline between low rate and high rate stimulation.</description>

            <title>Change in Back Pain Intensity</title>
            <description>Back pain intensity was measured on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (0=&quot;no pain&quot;, 10=&quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;) at baseline and following low rate and high rate stimulation. This outcome measure compared the change in intensity from baseline between low rate and high rate stimulation.</description>

      <desc>Trial lead insertion was on Day 0, followed by 2 study periods lasting 3-4 days each. Though 18 subjects started stimulation, 20 subjects enrolled and had procedures performed. Two subjects withdrew after attempted lead insertion but before stimulation. Thus, the &quot;At Risk&quot; population during trial lead insertion is reported as 20, not 18.</desc>
