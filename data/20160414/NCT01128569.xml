    <textblock>
      We propose to use an inhaled allergen challenge model to explore the individual
      contributions of the components of a novel long-acting beta agonist (LABA)/ inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) combination product on protection from allergic triggers in asthma.

    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants (par.) were exposed to an allergen (administered by inhalation) 22-23 hours after dosing on Day 28. FEV1 was measured 5 minutes (min), 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 45 min and 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours post-allergen challenge on Day 29. Immediately prior to the exposure of allergen and starting at 2 minutes after inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded at 1-minute intervals, and the best was taken as the post-saline value. The FEV1 weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and then dividing the value by the relevant time interval. Weighted mean change from Baseline is calculated as the weighted mean FEV1 value on Day 29 minus the Baseline value. The Baseline FEV1 value was the post-saline value on Day 29.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 22-23 hours after dosing on Day 28. Immediately prior to the exposure of allergen and starting at 2 minutes (min) after inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1were recorded at 1-min intervals, and the best was taken as the post-saline value. The maximum change (i.e., drop in FEV1) from post-saline Baseline (BL) is defined by ordering all of the change from BL values for the 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 45 min and the 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours post-allergen challenge and selecting the largest change (i.e., drop in FEV1) from the BL value. If there were no negative change values, indicating a worse FEV1 value as compared to the BL value, the smallest change in FEV1, indicating an improvement from the BL value, was selected. The BL FEV1 value was the post-saline value on Day 29.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 22-23 hours after dosing on Day 28. Immediately prior to the exposure of allergen and starting at 2 minutes after inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1were recorded at 1-minute intervals, and the best was taken as the post-saline value. The minimum FEV1 over 0-2 hours post-allergen challenge (PAC) (minimum early asthmatic response) was the minimum value of all of the PAC time points up to and including 2 hours PAC (i.e., minimum over 5 minutes (min), 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 45 min and 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours). Change from Baseline was calculated using the post-saline FEV1 on Day 29 as Baseline. Minimum FEV1 absolute change from Baseline between 0-2 hour, following the 22-23 hour post-treatment allergen challenge was calculated as the minimum change value on Day 29 minus the Baseline value</description>

    <description>The number of participants with treatment-emergent AEs was measured. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatments, or any event already present that worsens in either intensity of frequency following exposure to the treatments.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were screened within 42 days of the first dose, conducted over 2 days (not consecutive days). During this time, a methacholine challenge and an allergen challenge test were performed. Participants meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomized to 3 study treatment periods, each lasting 28 days.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three-period crossover study in mild asthmatic male and female participants. Following the Run-in period, participants were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences of placebo, FF 100 micrograms (µg) once daily (OD), and FF/VI 100/25 µg OD.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants were randomized to receive treatment in one of the six following sequences: (1) Placebo, FF 100 µg, FF/VI 100/25 µg; (2) Placebo, FF/VI 100/25 µg, FF 100 µg; (3) FF 100 µg, FF/VI 100/25 µg, Placebo; (4) FF 100 µg, Placebo, FF/VI 100/25 µg; (5) FF/VI 100/25 µg, Placebo, FF 100 µg; (6) FF/VI 100/25 µg, FF 100 µg, Placebo. The three treatment periods were separated by a washout period of at least 21 days (from the Day 28 dose) and a maximum of 35 days.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Between 0–2 Hours, Following the 22–23 Hour Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 29 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants (par.) were exposed to an allergen (administered by inhalation) 22-23 hours after dosing on Day 28. FEV1 was measured 5 minutes (min), 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 45 min and 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours post-allergen challenge on Day 29. Immediately prior to the exposure of allergen and starting at 2 minutes after inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded at 1-minute intervals, and the best was taken as the post-saline value. The FEV1 weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and then dividing the value by the relevant time interval. Weighted mean change from Baseline is calculated as the weighted mean FEV1 value on Day 29 minus the Baseline value. The Baseline FEV1 value was the post-saline value on Day 29.</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Decrease From Baseline in FEV1 Between 0 2 Hour, Following the 22–23 Hour Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 29 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 22-23 hours after dosing on Day 28. Immediately prior to the exposure of allergen and starting at 2 minutes (min) after inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1were recorded at 1-min intervals, and the best was taken as the post-saline value. The maximum change (i.e., drop in FEV1) from post-saline Baseline (BL) is defined by ordering all of the change from BL values for the 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 45 min and the 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours post-allergen challenge and selecting the largest change (i.e., drop in FEV1) from the BL value. If there were no negative change values, indicating a worse FEV1 value as compared to the BL value, the smallest change in FEV1, indicating an improvement from the BL value, was selected. The BL FEV1 value was the post-saline value on Day 29.</description>

Change from BL was calculated as the value on Day 29 minus the BL value.</population>
