    <textblock>
      The Autologous Cell Therapy for Female SUI study is a clinical trial to determine the safety
      and potential effectiveness of a single dose of 200 million Cook MyoSite Autologous Muscle
      Derived Cells for treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence.

    <description>Biopsy was required to generate AMDC products. Biopsy procedure-related events were defined as systemic responses to the biopsy procedure or injury at the biopsy site. Since biopsy occurred prior to AMDC treatment, results are presented independent of AMDC dose received. All biopsy procedure-related events either self-resolved or were easily treated.</description>

    <description>AMDC treatment was administered via intrasphincteric injection. Injection procedure-related events were defined as systemic responses to the injection procedure or genitourinary events occurring within 30 days of the injection procedure that could be attributed to cystoscopy or catheterization. Since these events could be attributed to the injection procedure, results are considered independent of AMDC dose received. All injection procedure-related events self-resolved or were easily treated.</description>

    <description>If an immune response after injection or any urinary retention occurred and seemed suspicious, the physicians were consulted to determine whether the effect was likely related to the AMDC product.
No adverse events reported during the study were adjudicated as AMDC product-related.</description>
