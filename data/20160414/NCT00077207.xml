      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide,
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving
      more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This pilot study is studying giving carboplatin and vincristine together with
      temozolomide in treating children with progressive and/or symptomatic low-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of an induction and maintenance regimen
           comprising carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide in children with progressive
           and/or symptomatic low-grade gliomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 3-year progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate response and progression-free survival with the genomic profile of tumors in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and
           22; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and oral temozolomide on days
           43-47. Four weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients achieving stable
           or responding disease proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive carboplatin and temozolomide as in induction
           therapy and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 10 weeks for a
           total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

    <description>Success is defined as the completion of induction plus one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks of enrollment without more than a 25% reduction in either carboplatin or temozolomide dosage.
Failure to complete the induction and one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks counts as a short-term-feasibility failure.</description>

    <measure>Long Term Feasibility Success</measure>
    <time_frame>60 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Success is defined as the completion of induction plus four cycles of maintenance within 60 weeks of enrollment without more than a 25% reduction in either carboplatin or temozolomide dosage.
If the participant completes all therapy within 60 weeks the patient is a long-term feasibility success. As such, a patient who experiences short term feasibility failure can be classified as a long-term feasibility success.</description>

        <title>Short Term Feasibility Success</title>
        <description>Success is defined as the completion of induction plus one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks of enrollment without more than a 25% reduction in either carboplatin or temozolomide dosage.
Failure to complete the induction and one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks counts as a short-term-feasibility failure.</description>

        <population>Fourteen (14) patients were considered not evaluable for short-term toxicity because: ineligible - 1 patient; progression during induction - 9 patients; progression during maintenance 2 patients; parent preference - 1 patient and infection resulting in termination of protocol therapy - 1 patient.</population>

Four weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients achieving stable or responding disease proceed to maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy: Patients receive carboplatin (175/m2) and temozolomide (200 mg/m2) as in induction therapy and vincristine IV ((1.5 mg/m2) day 1 of weeks 10,11,12. Treatment repeats every 10 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.
