  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence of adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) reported among adolescent
      females and substantial reports of perpetration by young males, effective prevention
      programs to prevent ARA are limited. Male athletes are an important target for prevention
      efforts given their higher rates of abuse perpetration compared to non-athlete peers as well
      as their social influence among their peers. This cluster-randomized school-based
      investigation examines the effectiveness of a program for the primary prevention of ARA.
      &quot;Coaching Boys into Men&quot; (CBIM) is a social norms theory-based program intended to alter
      norms that foster ARA perpetration, promote bystander intervention, and reduce ARA
      perpetration by engaging athletic coaches as positive role models to deliver violence
      prevention scripts and tools to high school age male athletes. Coaches receive a 60-minute
      training session to administer the intervention to their athletes via 11 lessons across a
      sport season. Trained high school coaches talk to their male athletes about 1) what
      constitutes disrespectful and harmful vs. respectful behaviors, 2) promoting more
      gender-equitable attitudes, and 3) modeling bystander intervention when disrespectful
      behaviors toward women and girls are witnessed. The current investigation evaluates the
      intervention in 16 urban high schools randomized either to receive the CBIM program (i.e.,
      intervention schools, n=8) or to a control condition (n=8). Baseline computer-based surveys
      are collected for all intervention and control site student athletes entering grades 9
      through 12 at the start of each of three sports seasons across Year 1 (Time 1). Follow up
      surveys are collected for these same athletes at the end of their first sports season (Time
      2). Participating athletes in grades 9 - 11 at baseline are re-surveyed 12 months after Time
      1 to examine the longer term effects of the CBIM intervention (Time 3; N of athletes
      completing all 3 waves of data collection = 1500). Primary assessment of intervention
      effects are based on intent-to-treat estimates, utilizing generalized linear mixed models to
      account for clustering arising from school randomization. Hypothesized outcomes for male
      athletes include a) an increase in recognition of what constitutes abusive behaviors, b)
      more gender-equitable attitudes, c) an increase in intentions and reports of bystander
      intervention regarding ARA, and through these intermediate outcomes, d) a decrease in
      perpetration of ARA among adolescent male athletes.

      Additional process evaluation includes baseline and follow up surveys with coaches (from
      both intervention and control arms), individual interviews with coaches, as well as focus
      groups with students to collect coach and athlete perspectives on the relevance and local
      impact of the intervention program.
