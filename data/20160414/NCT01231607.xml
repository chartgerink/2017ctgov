  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this six month study is to show that dutasteride is safe and more effective
      than placebo, and at least as safe and effective as finasteride in treating hair loss in men
      with androgenetic alopecia. Three doses of dutasteride will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgenetic alopecia is a common, androgen-induced, pattern of progressive loss of scalp
      hair with an onset at any age after puberty in genetically predisposed people. The influence
      of androgens on scalp hair growth is mediated by local and systemic conversion of
      testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase. 5 alpha-reductase has
      been shown to exist as 2 isoenzyme forms, Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is predominantly located
      in the skin, both in the hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and is also found in the liver
      and kidney . Type 2 is the dominant form in male genitalia, including the prostate, although
      it has also been reported to be present in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. The
      presence of both isoenzymes in the hair follicles suggests that both forms are likely to be
      important in the pathogenesis and treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Inhibition of both
      Type 1 and Type 2 5 alpha-reductase may be expected to more effectively reduce systemic and
      local dihydrotestosterone levels than inhibition of either isoenzyme alone.

      Finasteride is a selective Type 2 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor that is currently the only
      approved oral treatment for androgenetic alopecia worldwide. Dutasteride inhibits both Type
      1 and Type 2 5alpha-reductase and is approved in more than 80 countries for the treatment of
      benign prostatic hyperplasia, and in Korea for the treatment of hair loss. Dutasteride is
      approximately 3 times as potent as finasteride at inhibiting Type 2 5 alpha-reductase and
      more than 100 times as potent at inhibiting Type 1 5 alpha-reductase.

      In a Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (ARIA2004) conducted in the
      United States, dutasteride demonstrated significant increases in target area hair count, as
      compared with placebo, as early as 12 weeks. In a Phase III double- blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical study conducted in Korea, dutasteride 0.5 milligram (mg)
      demonstrated significant increases in target area hair count, as compared with placebo, at
      24 weeks. This 6 month study is being conducted to provide additional evidence of the
      efficacy and safety of three doses of dutasteride (0.02, 0.1 and 0.5mg) in the treatment of
      androgenetic alopecia, and more specifically, to characterize the dose-response relationship
      in an ethnically-diverse population. Treatment arms will be equally balanced with
      approximately 180 per arm.

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Target Area Hair Count (HC) Within a 2.54 Centimeter (cm) (1 Inch) Diameter Circle at the Vertex at Week 24, as Assessed by Macrophotographic Technique (MT)</title>
        <description>The primary target area HC was based on the nonvellus hair (&gt;=30 micrometers [μm] in width; thick and noticeable hair) count within a target 2.54 cm (1 inch) diameter circle at the vertex (crown, topmost part of the head). A cosmetic ink dot was placed by tattoo at BL so that the same area could be identified at BL and post-BL. If the ink dot faded, it was re-done in exactly the same location to ensure visibility for subsequent photographs. For the MT, hair was clipped before each photograph; HC was based on hair follicles in the photographs. Change from BL=Week 24 value minus the BL value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Target Area Hair Count Within a 1.13 cm (0.44 Inch) Diameter Circle at the Vertex at Week 24, as Assessed by MT</title>
        <description>The primary target area HC was based on the nonvellus hair (&gt;=30 micrometers [μm] in width; thick and noticeable hair) count within a target 1.13 cm (0.44 inch) diameter circle at the vertex (crown, topmost part of the head). A cosmetic ink dot was placed by tattoo at BL so that the same area could be identified at BL and post-BL. If the ink dot faded, it was re-done in exactly the same location to ensure visibility for subsequent photographs. For the MT, hair was clipped before each photograph; HC was based on hair follicles in the photographs. Change from BL=Week 24 value minus the BL value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Target Area Hair Width Within a 2.54 cm (1 Inch) Diameter Circle at the Vertex at Week 12 and Week 24, as Assessed by MT</title>
        <description>The target area hair width was the sum of all nonvellus hairs (&gt;=30 µm in width; thick and noticeable hair) within a target 2.54 cm (1 inch) diameter circle at the vertex (crown, topmost part of the head). For the MT, hair was clipped before each photograph. A cosmetic ink dot was placed by tattoo at Baseline so that the same area could be identified at Baseline and post-Baseline. If the ink dot faded, it was re-done in exactly the same location to ensure it was visible for subsequent photographs. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 or Week 24 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <title>Change From Baseline in Terminal Hair Count Within a 1.13 cm (0.44 Inch) Diameter Circle at the Vertex at Week 12 and Week 24, as Assessed by MT</title>
            <description>The THC (thick, long, and dark hair) was the sum of all nonvellus hairs (&gt;=60 μm in width; thick and noticeable hair) within a target 1.13 cm (0.44 inch) diameter circle at the vertex (crown, topmost part of the head). A cosmetic ink dot was placed by tattoo at BL so that the same area could be identified at BL and post-BL. If the ink dot faded, it was re-done in exactly the same location to ensure visibility for subsequent photographs. For the MT, hair was clipped before each photograph; HC was based on hair follicles in the photographs. Change from BL=Week 12/Week 24 value minus BL value.</description>

        <title>Global Assessment of Improvement From Baseline to Week 24 Assessed for Vertex and Frontal Views Separately</title>
        <description>A central panel of 3 dermatologists independently assessed change in hair growth from Baseline to Week 24 using a 7-point scale: greatly decreased (-3), moderately decreased (-2), slightly decreased (-1), no change (0), slightly increased (1), moderately increased (2), and greatly increased (3). The median score, across the 3 panel members, is summarized. This assessment was performed by comparing the global photographs obtained at Baseline with those subsequently obtained at Week 24. This assessment was made separately based on the global photography of the vertex and frontal views.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline (BL) in the Stage (S) of Androgenic Alopecia (AGA) According to the Norwood-Hamilton Scale at Week 12 (W12)</title>
        <description>The investigator/designee assessed the stage (Stage I to Stage VII) of AGA (i.e., male pattern baldness [MPB]) by utilizing the Norwood-Hamilton scale, used to measure the progression of MPB. Stage VII indicates worse balding than stage I. Assessment was made by direct visual examination (aided by pictures) of the participant at Baseline and Week 12 (W12). &quot;v,&quot; vertex; most of the hair loss (commonly seen with advancing age) is on the vertex. &quot;a,&quot; type a variant; major features are (1) the entire anterior hairline border recedes in unison; (2) there is no simultaneous balding of the vertex.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline (BL) in the Stage (S) of Androgenic Alopecia (AGA) According to the Norwood-Hamilton Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>The investigator/designee assessed the stage (Stage I to Stage VII) of AGA (i.e., male pattern baldness [MPB]) by utilizing the Norwood-Hamilton scale, used to measure the progression of MPB. Stage VII indicates worse balding than stage I. Assessment was made by direct visual examination (aided by pictures) of the participant at Baseline and Week 24 (W24). &quot;v,&quot; vertex; most of the hair loss (commonly seen with advancing age) is on the vertex. &quot;a,&quot; type a variant; major features are (1) the entire anterior hairline border recedes in unison; (2) there is no simultaneous balding of the vertex.</description>

        <population>ITT Population. Calculation was based on the LOCF imputation method for missing data. All participants for whom data were collected at both Baseline and Week 24 were assessed.
