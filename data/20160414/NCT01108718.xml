  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a new mattress relieves the symptoms
      of fibromyalgia and improves sleep, and if this is the case, whether one type of mattress is
      better than the other in doing so.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The various stages of sleep will be monitored via polysomnography(PSG) and scored to
      indicate the degree to which they reflect a normal sleep pattern. Changes in the severity of
      fibromyalgia symptoms will be assessed by tender point exam and study questionnaires
      administered at 2 month intervals.

    <description>Study patients were asked to rate each test mattress after 2 months of use, based on their quality of sleep and severity of symptoms relating to fibromyalgia. The various stages of sleep were monitored via polysomnography(PSG) and scored to indicate the degree to which they reflect a normal sleep pattern. Change in severity of fibromyalgia symptoms were assessed by chi-squared and t-test.</description>
