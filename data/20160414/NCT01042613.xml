      1. This study will compare the first attempt success rate of cannulation in research
           participants randomized to using a new FDA approved AccuVein AV300 device for
           intravenous access with research participants randomized to standard cannulation
           methods.

        2. This study will assess if insertion of intravenous cannula is faster when intravenous
           access is assisted by the AccuVein AV300 device as compared to the standard technique.

        3. This study will assess if the number of skin punctures is fewer when intravenous access
           is assisted by the AccuVein AV300 device as compared to the standard technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients agreeing to participate in this study will be randomized to one of two groups for
      intravenous access. One group will use the standard cannulation method and the other group
      will use the new FDA approved AccuVein AV300 device for cannulation.

      After pre-anesthetic evaluation, the research participant will be brought to the operating
      room or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Suite and standard monitoring will be applied (EKG,
      SpO2, BP) if tolerated. Anesthesia will be induced via a face mask with sevoflurane in 100%
      O2. When the supervising anesthesiologist deems it appropriate, attempt at cannulation will
      begin.

      A tourniquet will be applied. A 22-gauge cannula will be used. Randomization will take place
      before the patient is taken back to the Operating Room or MRI Suite. If the research
      participant has been randomized to the standard treatment group then cannulation will be
      attempted in the standard manner. If the research participant has been randomized to the
      AV300 device group then intravenous cannulation will be attempted using the AV300 device
      following the manufacturer's instructions.

      A research team member will time cannulation access for all participants. Participation ends
      once successful cannulation is achieved or when a maximum of 4 skin punctures have been
      made.

      Only the study coordinator will know which randomization group the patient has been
      assigned. Once the anesthesiologist has determined a potential IV access site, s/he will be
      informed to which group the patient was assigned. If the parent/guardian requests, s/he will
      be told after the procedure to which group the child was randomized.
