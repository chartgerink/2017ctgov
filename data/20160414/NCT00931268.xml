    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain at sitting was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS with the descriptors 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to the left and 100 = &quot;worst possible pain&quot; to the right. Pain was assessed by the subject after sitting 15 minutes on a standardized chair. The VAS pain at 6 months was compared to baseline and the change was calculated.</description>

    <description>Number of participants maintaining an improvement compared to baseline using the Global Esthetic Improvement Scale (GEIS) consisting of 5 grades (worse/no change/improved/much improved/very much improved), where the three latter indicates improvement. GEIS was assessed at the time points 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months compared to pre-treatment photos.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>MRI was performed at baseline and at 1, 6, 9, and 12 months to determine the implant volume, thickness, localization and the possible local displacement of the implant. At the 6, 9 and 12 month visits any displacement was evaluated with MRI by comparison to the 1-month position of the gel.
