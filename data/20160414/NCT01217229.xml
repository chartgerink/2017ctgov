  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PLX3397 is a selective inhibitor of Fms, Kit, and oncogenic Flt3 activity.The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate,
      of orally administered PLX3397 in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL). Secondary objectives include safety, the duration of response, the disease
      control rate, progression free survival, and how the drug affects your body.

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for response and disease progression with contrast CT/18FDG-PET scans every two cycles. Each cycle is 28 days. Response to treatment as defined by Cheson criteria will be reported via descriptive statistics. Per Cheson Criteria: Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) is regression of measurable disease and no new sites (≥50% decrease in sum of product diameters of up to 6 largest dominant masses and splenic/liver nodules), and no increase in size of other nodes/liver/spleen; reduction in target lesions, no growth of non-target or new lesions; Progression is any new lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from the nadir.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ≥18 years old

          2. Pathologic confirmation of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, with
             archival or fresh tissue available for retrospective analysis.

          3. Patients must have progressed after-or been ineligible for-autologous stem cell
             transplantation. Patients who received a prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation
             are eligible if they have no evidence of GVHD and have been off immunosuppression for
             at least 3 months prior to C1D1.

          4. Documented disease that is radiographically measurable (≥2 cm in the largest
             transverse dimension).

          5. Patients must have discontinued any previous monoclonal antibody, radioimmunotherapy,
             or cytotoxic chemotherapy at least 28 days prior to C1D1 and must have recovered
             fully from the side effects of that treatment prior to beginning study treatment.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             initiation of dosing and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control
             while on study drug and for 3 months after the last dose. Women of non-childbearing
             potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been
             postmenopausal for ≥1 year. Men of child-bearing potential must also agree to use an
             acceptable method of birth control while on study drug.

          7. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          8. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 x
             109/L, Hgb &gt;9 g/dL, platelet count ≥50 x 109/L, AST/ALT ≤2.5x ULN, creatinine ≤1.5x
             ULN)

          9. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigational drug use within 28 days of the first dose of PLX3397

          2. History or clinical evidence of central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural
             disease including brain metastasis

          3. Patients with another active cancer [excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical
             intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical carcinoma in situ) or melanoma in situ]. Prior
             history of other cancer is allowed, as long as there was no active disease within the
             prior 5 years.

          4. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, an active or uncontrolled infection,
             or a fever &gt;38.5˚C (not due to tumor fever) on C1D1

          5. Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, biliary shunt, or significant bowel
             resection that would preclude adequate absorption

          6. Patients with serious illnesses, medical conditions, or other medical history
             including abnormal laboratory results, which in the investigator's opinion would be
             likely to interfere with a patient's participation in the study, or with the
             interpretation of the results

          7. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding

          8. QTc ≥450 msec
