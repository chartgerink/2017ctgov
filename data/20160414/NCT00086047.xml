  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition that can cause considerable suffering and
      difficulty in an adolescent's day-to-day activities. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether coping skills training, when combined with usual medical care, can reduce
      pain and disability in adolescents with fibromyalgia.

      Study hypotheses: 1) Adolescents who receive coping skills training combined with their
      usual medical care will show significantly greater reductions in functional disability,
      pain, and depressive symptoms at the end of the acute treatment phase than adolescents who
      receive fibromyalgia education with their usual medical care. 2) Adolescents who receive
      coping skills training with their usual medical care will show significantly lower levels of
      functional disability, pain, and depressive symptoms at the end of a six-month maintenance
      phase than adolescents who receive fibromyalgia education with their usual medical care.

    <textblock>
      Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) is a debilitating chronic pain condition that
      occurs in adolescence and is characterized by persistent pain, multiple tender points, sleep
      difficulty, and fatigue. The cause of JPFS is unknown and there is no known cure. Children
      and adolescents with JPFS have difficulty with daily functioning, miss a great deal of
      school, and experience increased emotional distress compared to their peers. Fibromyalgia
      syndrome appears to be resistant to treatment in adulthood, so early behavioral treatment
      for JPFS with long-term beneficial effects would be useful. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of coping skills training (CST) when combined with usual medical care in reducing
      functional disability, pain intensity, and depressive symptoms in adolescents with JPFS.
      This study will also determine whether improvements can be sustained long-term.

      This study will last 34 weeks. Participants will be recruited from three pediatric
      rheumatology clinics. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: CST plus
      usual medical care or education plus usual medical care. There will be 6 medical visits,
      spaced 4 to 5 weeks apart. In addition, patients will attend 8 individual sessions of CST or
      education over the first 8 weeks of the study. CST sessions will include training in
      cognitive-behavioral techniques of pain management for the adolescent and behavioral
      management techniques for their parents. Education sessions will include education on
      fibromyalgia and discussion about lifestyle issues, but no training in pain management
      procedures.

      Patients will be evaluated at Week 9 and will be followed for an additional 6-month
      maintenance phase. During this maintenance phase, adolescents will continue to receive their
      usual medical care and will attend 2 additional sessions of CST or education. There will be
      one final evaluation at the end of the maintenance phase.
