  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mirabilis High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Treatment System delivers therapeutic
      focused ultrasound energy to the uterus under integrated ultrasound imaging guidance to
      offer non-invasive treatment for uterine fibroids. The purpose of this clinical study is to
      assess the initial safety and performance of the Mirabilis HIFU Treatment System for
      transabdominal treatment of uterine fibroids in eligible women who are scheduled to undergo
      hysterectomy following treatment with the device or who are seeking relief from
      fibroid-related symptoms.

    <description>Safety of the treatment was determined by evaluating the incidence of Adverse Events and Adverse Device Effects. Adverse Device Effects are Adverse Events that are related to treatment with the device. Relatedness of an Adverse Event to the treatment was determined on a case-by-case basis by the investigator. The average number of Serious Adverse Device Effects per patient and the average number of Non-Serious Adverse Device Effects per patient are reported to provide numeric outcomes of this evaluation.</description>

    <description>Efficacy of the treatment was quantified by measuring the HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volume (NPV) of tissue in each patient using either post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or pathology assessment following hysterectomy.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>All patients underwent transabdominal uterine fibroid treatment with the Mirabilis High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment System between January 8, 2011 and November 21, 2014 at two clinical sites in Mexico. The study was completed on May 20, 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were screened prior to treatment for eligibility criteria including size, location, and tissue characteristics of their uterine fibroid(s). Those patients meeting the established eligibility criteria were then scheduled for treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

      <time_frame>Monitoring for Adverse Events occurred from January 8, 2011 until May 20, 2015. Adverse Events were monitored until each patient's exit from the study, which was up to 6 months following treatment.</time_frame>
      <desc>All Adverse Events are reported for all patients receiving treatment, including those events not related to treatment. Adverse Events were reported spontaneously by patients, observed by the investigator or other personnel, and/or elicited during patient queries at regular follow-up intervals. Descriptions were mapped to standardized terms.</desc>
