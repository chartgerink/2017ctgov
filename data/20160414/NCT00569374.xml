    <textblock>
      This 7 week, open-label pilot clinical trial will examine the safety and tolerability of
      modafinil up to 400mg/day as a potential treatment to reduce methamphetamine use in
      methamphetamine-dependent volunteers.

    <time_frame>Weekly for 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Modafinil side effects were measured weekly by means of the Modafinil Side Effects Checklist which asked participants to rate their experience of the following potential side effects: headaches, nausea, nervousness, runny nose, diarrhea, back pain, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness and upset stomach. Participants rated their experience on a 4 point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much (4). The score was determined by units on a scale.</description>

    <measure>Methamphetamine Withdrawal as Measured Using the Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Thrice weekly for the first three weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire was given at intake and 3 times weekly during the first 3 weeks of the study. This time span was chosen due to the tendency of methamphetamine withdrawal to enter an acute phase in the first week after last use with a subsequent subacute phase following for the next two weeks(McGregor et al, 2005). This questionaire is comprised of 10 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40.</description>

        <title>&quot;Modafinil Side Effects Checklist&quot;</title>
        <description>Modafinil side effects were measured weekly by means of the Modafinil Side Effects Checklist which asked participants to rate their experience of the following potential side effects: headaches, nausea, nervousness, runny nose, diarrhea, back pain, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness and upset stomach. Participants rated their experience on a 4 point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much (4). The score was determined by units on a scale.</description>
        <time_frame>Weekly for 7 weeks</time_frame>
        <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
        <population>The data reported was obtainined by computing the overall mean numberical score on the Modafinil Side Effects Checklist for each participant, then using these to compute the overall mean. The checklist is a 10 item scale with each item scoring between 0 (none) to 4 (worst). The potential scores range from 0 (least) to 40 (worst).</population>

        <title>Methamphetamine Withdrawal as Measured Using the Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire.</title>
        <description>The Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire was given at intake and 3 times weekly during the first 3 weeks of the study. This time span was chosen due to the tendency of methamphetamine withdrawal to enter an acute phase in the first week after last use with a subsequent subacute phase following for the next two weeks(McGregor et al, 2005). This questionaire is comprised of 10 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events included one report each of tachycardia and dry mouth. The third occurred when a subject missed a dose on one day and took a double dose the next day. The subject experienced tachycardia, dry mouth, nervousness which resolved within one hour of modafinil ingestion.</desc>
