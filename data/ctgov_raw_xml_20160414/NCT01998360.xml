    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new, minimally-invasive surgical circumcision technique for men,
      which is easy to learn and perform, is safe, and is associated with high patient
      satisfaction and excellent cosmetic results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a priority preventive intervention for HIV
      transmission. Currently, the most widely used VMMC technique in South Africa is open
      surgical circumcision.

      According to the Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Devices for Adult Male Circumcision
      (WHO, 2011): &quot;WHO and other health authorities wish to identify one or more devices that (a)
      would make the VMMC safer, easier, and quicker; (b) would have more rapid healing than
      current methods and/or might entail less risk of HIV transmission in the post-operative
      period; (c) could be performed safely by health-care providers with a minimal level of
      training; and (d) would be cost-effective compared to standard surgical methods for male
      circumcision scale up.&quot;

      This quasi-experimental compares the open surgical technique to an alternative
      minimally-invasive technique using the disposable Unicirc device with tissue adhesive. The
      controls come from a separate randomized controlled trial (Unicirc 001) that was conducted
      just prior to the Unicirc 002 case series of 50 subjects. The investigators postulate that
      VMMC using the Unicirc device meets WHO criteria for the ideal method to scale up: it is an
      easier technique to learn and perform, requires less intraoperative time, is safer for both
      surgeons and patients, heals quicker, and is more cost effective than other currently
      available techniques. The disposable nature of the device is an immense advantage as it
      eliminates the need to sterilize and can therefore be used in resource-limited settings. It
      also reduces the chances of infection caused by contaminated instruments.
