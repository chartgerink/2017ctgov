  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab
      (Lucentis) in treatment of corneal neovascularization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single site, uncontrolled, single group assignment, safety/efficacy,
      Phase I study of topical administered ranibizumab in subjects with corneal
      neovascularization. Ten eyes of patients with corneal neovascularization will be recruited.
      Patients with superficial or deep corneal neovascularization that extends farther than 2 mm
      from the limbus will be considered.
