  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-produced locomotion often is limited in children with cerebral palsy and other
      conditions that cause severe motor impairments. As a result, these children may be at risk
      for secondary impairments in spatial cognition, communication, social development, and other
      domains influenced by independent mobility. To compensate, power mobility has increasingly
      been advocated for young children with severe motor impairments. The study hypotheses were:

        1. Children with severe disabilities that prevent independent locomotion who learn to use
           power mobility devices when they are 14- to 30-months-of-age will have greater
           communication, social, and cognitive development over a 12-month period, and will
           demonstrate more competent coping skills than children with the same characteristics
           who do not use power mobility.

        2. Parents of children who use power mobility will view it as a positive influence on
           their children's lives, and will perceive their children's development to be more
           mature than the parents of children who do not use power mobility will perceive their
           children's development.

      <recruitment_details>Children were recruited from throughout Oklahoma between February 2002 and December 2003. They were recruited through the statewide early intervention program, parent groups, radio, and contacts with occupational and physical therapists.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>We used a matched pairs design and did not find matches for some of the children before they became too old for the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Power Wheelchair</title>
          <description>Children were provided custom-fitted Invacare Power Tiger power wheelchairs to use in their homes and communities for 12 months. Parents were primarily responsible for providing practice opportunities and instruction, with the childrenâ€™s early intervention therapists and research staff helping to solve any problems. Parents were asked to: (1) provide the child with daily opportunities to sit in the device with the motor turned on during play; (2) encourage the child to experiment with movement in a relatively large space and not be concerned if the child drove in circles; and (3) avoid telling the child what to do, but rather to let the child ex experiment unless frustrated or unsafe. The importance of parental supervision, as one would supervise any young child, was stressed. The children also received their usual early intervention services, as specified on their individualized family service plans.</description>

          <title>Power Wheelchair</title>
          <description>Children were provided custom-fitted Invacare Power Tiger power wheelchairs to use in their homes and communities for 12 months. Parents were primarily responsible for providing practice opportunities and instruction, with the childrenâ€™s early intervention therapists and research staff helping to solve any problems. Parents were asked to: (1) provide the child with daily opportunities to sit in the device with the motor turned on during play; (2) encourage the child to experiment with movement in a relatively large space and not be concerned if the child drove in circles; and (3) avoid telling the child what to do, but rather to let the child ex experiment unless frustrated or unsafe. The importance of parental supervision, as one would supervise any young child, was stressed. The children also received their usual early intervention services, as specified on their individualized family service plans.</description>
