  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact on nasopharyngeal carriage, safety and immunogenicity of
      GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A given as a 3-dose vaccination course and
      co-administered with other routine paediatric vaccines in infants in The Gambia. Two
      formulations containing different doses of pneumococcal antigen and two different schedules
      will be tested in infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two cohorts in the study: Cohort 1 (children aged 2-4 years) and Cohort 2
      (infants aged 8-10 weeks), and two steps in the study, Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 will
      consist in a safety evaluation of the GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A (GSK
      2189242A or 10PP vaccine). Before evaluating the two formulations of the 10PP vaccine in
      infants (Cohort 2), safety and reactogenicity of the highest dose formulation of this
      vaccine will be evaluated in children (Cohort 1). Prevnar 13™ will be used as a control. In
      the second step of the study, Step 2, two investigational formulations of the 10PP vaccine
      will be tested in infants (Cohort 2) as regards immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety.
      Both formulations of the 10PP vaccine will be evaluated according to the Expanded Programme
      on Immunization (EPI) schedule i.e. a 2, 3, 4 months vaccination schedule, using licensed
      Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™ vaccines as comparators. The higher dose (HD) formulation of the
      10PP vaccine will be also evaluated according to the 2, 4, 9 months vaccination schedule
      using licensed Synflorix™ vaccine as comparator. The study in infants will also assess the
      immune responses to routine vaccines when co-administered with the candidate pneumococcal
      vaccine, using licensed Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™ vaccines as comparators.

    <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 = Occurrence of AE which prevented normal activities. Related = Occurrence of AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Primary results correspond to results for occurrences of Grade 3 unsolicited AE(s) assessed as related to vaccination. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 1/Step 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) With and Without Relationship to Vaccination - In Step 1/Cohort 1 Subjects</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 = Occurrence of AE which prevented normal activities. Related = Occurrence of AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Primary results correspond to results for occurrences of Grade 3 unsolicited AE(s) assessed as related to vaccination. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 1/Step 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited General Symptoms and With Solicited General Symptoms With Relationship to Vaccination – For Step 2/Cohort 2 Subjects Receiving the 2+1 Schedule</title>
        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were Drowsiness, Fever (axillary temperature higher than [≥] 37.5 degrees Celsius [°C]), Irritability/Fussiness and Loss of appetite. Any = Occurrence of the specified solicited general symptom, regardless of intensity. Related = Occurrence of the specified symptom assessed by the investigators as causally related to vaccination. Grade 3 Drowsiness = Drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Fever = Axillary temperature higher than (&gt;) 39.5°C. Grade 3 Irritability/fussiness = Crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Loss of appetite = Subject did not eat at all. This outcome concerns Step 2/Cohort 2 subjects receiving the 2+1 Schedule.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) – For Step 2/Cohort 2 Subjects Receiving the 3+0 Schedule</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. This outcome concerns Step 2/Cohort 2 subjects receiving the 3+0 Schedule.</description>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 8-10 weeks at first vaccination enrolled as part the Cohort 2/Step 2 of the study who received the GSK 2189242A (or 10PP) vaccine, in its high-dose (HD) formulation, and EPI vaccines according to a 2+1 Schedule. That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age.. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

            <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. This outcome concerns Step 2/Cohort 2 subjects receiving the 2+1 Schedule.</description>
