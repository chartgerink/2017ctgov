      This study will evaluate the impact of investigator and patient education and educational
      materials to foster calcium and vitamin D supplementation to mitigate the potential for
      hypocalcemia post Reclast® administration in patients with Paget's disease of bone.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>To be included in the analysis, patients were required to have a baseline serum calcium of at least 2.07 mmol/L and at least one serum calcium measurement 9-11 days post-infusion of zoledronic acid. In case of multiple assessments, for baseline visit the last measurement prior to the first dose was used in the analysis, and for Visits 2 and 3, the lowest serum calcium in the visit window was used. hypocalcemia was defined as treatment-emergent serum calcium &lt;2.07 mmol/L at 9-11 days after the study drug infusion.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline = endpoint - baseline, at each time point, only participants with a value at baseline and that time point are included in the change from baseline column. In case of multiple assessments, for baseline visit the last measurement prior to the first dose was used in the analysis, and for Visits 2 and 3, the lowest serum calcium in the visit window was used.</description>

    <description>The end of study is not a separate time point. It is the last post-baseline, for majority the end of study was visit 2. There were 2 patients who had the end of study at Visit 3. If calcium at visit 2 was abnormal it was measured again at visit 3.</description>

            <description>Change from baseline = endpoint – baseline, at each time point, only participants with a value at baseline and that time point are included in the change from baseline column. In case of multiple assessments, for baseline visit the last measurement prior to the first dose was used in the analysis, and for Visits 2 and 3, the lowest serum calcium in the visit window was used.</description>

        <description>The end of study is not a separate time point. It is the last post-baseline, for majority the end of study was visit 2. There were 2 patients who had the end of study at Visit 3. If calcium at visit 2 was abnormal it was measured again at visit 3.</description>

        <population>This Outcome Measure uses Safety population which includes 81 patients. During monitoring it was discovered that one patient signed the consent form from another Paget’s study; therefore, this patient was excluded from the ITT population but included in the safety. The ITT population was used for participant flow and baseline characteristics.</population>
