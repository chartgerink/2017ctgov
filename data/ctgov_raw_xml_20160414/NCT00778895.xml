  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children younger than 5 years of age are at high risk for severe influenza disease (flu) and
      hospitalization due to flu. Scientists are in the process of re-evaluating the dosing
      initially based on whole virus vaccines to improve their efficacy in infants. In this study,
      we will compare two different dose levels of GSK1557482A flu vaccine. Another already
      approved flu vaccine made by a different company will be used as a control.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of two different dose levels of a new formulation of flu vaccine for the
      2008/2009 flu season using the World Health Organization recommended virus strains. Subjects
      will be randomly put into one of three different groups to receive either one or two doses
      of:

      0.25 mL dose of the new flu vaccine, or 0.5 mL dose of the new flu vaccine or the licensed
      Vaxigrip flu vaccine (control) The parents of the subjects and the study doctor and nurses
      will not know the group of their child until the study is completed.

      The children will be vaccinated with either one dose or two doses depending on whether or
      not they have received a flu vaccine before. The doctor will decide on the schedule for each
      child based on the information provided by the parents. The active phase of the study will
      last approximately two months for children receiving two doses and one month for those
      receiving a single dose. An extended safety follow-up will continue until Study Month 6.

      Two blood samples will be taken from each subject. These will be used to evaluate how well
      the vaccine works in the children and which dose level works best compared to the control.

      The parents will fill in a diary card for four days to record any reactions or symptoms
      which may occur after vaccination. Parents will also keep a record of other symptoms that
      may occur between vaccinations and up to six months after the first vaccination and will
      keep a record of any medication their child takes in this time period.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were differentiated according to priming status. Primed Subjects – subjects who had a prior 2-dose priming influenza immunization received a 1-dose vaccination course in the study. Unprimed Subjects – subjects who had not previously received a complete 2-dose priming influenza immunization received a 2-dose vaccination course in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study comprised an Active phase of approximately 2 months and a post-vaccination 180 day extended safety follow-up period (ESFU phase).
374 subjects out of the 390 who were enrolled in the study were vaccinated. Remaining subjects were not included in the participant flow as started as they failed to meet protocol criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever. Any was defined as occurrence of any general symptom regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = Axillary temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 fever = Axillary temperature ≥ 39.0°C. For other symptoms, grade 3 was defined as an adverse event which prevented normal everyday activities. Related = A general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. This primary outcome measure was assessed for Fluviral F1 Group and Fluviral F2 Group respectively as per the study protocol.</description>

            <description>MAEs were defined as events for which the subject received medical attention defined as hospitalization, an emergency room visit, or a visit to or from medical personnel (medical doctor) for any reason. Any MAE(s) = Occurrence of any MAE(s) regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.
Analysis of intensity and relationship to vaccination of MAEs was not performed.

            <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40, or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The flu strains assessed were the A/Brisbane (H1N1), A/Uruguay (H3N2) and B/Florida.</description>

        <description>Symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever. Any was defined as occurrence of any general symptom regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = Axillary temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius (°C).

Related = A general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.

            <description>Symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever. Any was defined as occurrence of any general symptom regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = Axillary temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 fever = Axillary temperature ≥ 39.0°C. For other symptoms, grade 3 was defined as an adverse event which prevented normal everyday activities. Related = A general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.

            <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) After Vaccination</title>
            <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any SAE(s) = Occurrence of any SAE(s) regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Related SAE(s) = Occurrence of any SAE(s) assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.
This secondary outcome measure was assessed for the Vaxigrip Group as per the study protocol.</description>
