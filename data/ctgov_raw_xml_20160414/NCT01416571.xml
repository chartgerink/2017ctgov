            <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were fatigue, gastrointestinal, headache, joint pain at other location (joint pain), muscle aches, shivering, sweating and fever. Any = occurrence of any solicited general symptoms regardless of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever was defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 = general symptom that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = fever ≥ 39.0°C. Related = general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination.</description>
