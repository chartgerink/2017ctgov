  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore horizontal transmission of the human rotavirus (HRV)
      vaccine strain within a family from the twin vaccinated with Rotarix to the twin receiving
      placebo. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment
      Act, Sep 2007.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b study. Three doses of Infanrix® hexa will be administered to all subjects
      at the discretion of the investigator.

      One complimentary dose of Rotarix will be administered to all infants enrolled in this study
      (both study groups) who are aged less than 6 months at Visit 3 (Week 13) as a benefit to the
      placebo group for participation in the study.

      The study will be conducted in a double-blind manner with respect to Rotarix and placebo
      administered at Visit 1 and Visit 2. The parents/guardians of the subjects will know that
      within each pair of twins, one subject will receive the Rotarix vaccine and one subject will
      receive the placebo.

      The study will be open label with respect to administration of the Rotarix vaccine dose
      given at Visit 3 to all subjects in each group who are aged less than 6 months.
