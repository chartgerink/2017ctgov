  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. The aim of the
      trial was to compare efficacy and safety of insulin degludec and insulin glargine in insulin
      naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes.

             inhibitor, alfa-glucosidase-inhibitors (acarbose) with unchanged dosing for at least
             3 months prior to randomisation (Visit 2) with the minimum doses stated: metformin:
             alone or in combination (including fixed combination) 1500 mg daily, or maximum
             tolerated dose (at least 1000 mg daily), insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or
