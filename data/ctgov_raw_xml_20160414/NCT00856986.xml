  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and North America. The aim of this clinical trial is to
      assess and compare the effect of insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide and
      metformin versus liraglutide and metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects will
      continue their own pre-trial metformin treatment during the trial.
