    <textblock>
      In the VIP (Veterans Intensive Personalized) Treatment in Heart Failure Study we will assess
      2 novel interventions to enhance adherence and improve quality of life in veterans with
      heart failure. This 3-arm randomized controlled trial will base one active arm on how ready
      patients are for change in terms of diet and medication adherence and will tailor the
      intervention based on this. The other active arm will also assess how ready patients are for
      change, but will also include tailoring based on availability of environment resources, such
      as proximity to health food stores or social support, to further tailor the intervention.
      The last active arm is simply an attention group where patients will receive general health
      counseling in addition to background care that all patients receive. The overarching
      hypothesis is that the tailored interventions will lower heart failure (HF) recurrence and
      improve quality of life by better medication and diet adherence compared to attention
      placebo.

      OBJECTIVES: In the VIP (Veterans Intensive Personalized) Treatment in Heart Failure Study we
      will assess 2 novel interventions to enhance adherence and improve quality of life (QOL) in
      veterans with heart failure (HF). This theory-based pilot 3-arm randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) will base one active arm on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), while the other active
      arm will add environmental (built and human) tailoring to TTM. The overarching hypothesis
      driving this proposal is that a behavioral intervention (BI), which uses the TTM, or a
      behavioral and environment-tailored intervention (BEI) will lower HF recurrence and improve
      QOL by better medication and diet adherence compared to attention control.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a practice-based RCT to test the effect of BI and BEI on medication
      and diet adherence. The study is embedded in typical VA healthcare with all 3 arms
      incorporating the enhancements in HF care that have been implemented including the Patient
      Aligned Care Teams (PACT), system redesign methods to improve HF care, ongoing HF quality
      improvement and Telehealth. We will randomize 99 participants equally to BI, BEI and AP. All
      analyses will be intent to treat.

      METHODOLOGY: The study sites will be the VAMC's at Manhattan and Brooklyn. Participants will
      be veterans with classes I-III HF with prescribed HF medication for 6 months. Men and women
      ( 21 years) with history and clinical findings of chronic, stable HF of NYHA functional
      class I (previously symptomatic/now asymptomatic), II, or III are eligible. They must have
      an available phone and 2 clinic visits in the previous 1.5 years. Patients with poor
      short-term survival (&lt; 1 year), recent major surgery (&lt; 3 months), temporarily in the area,
      or those unable to provide consent will be excluded. After being screened for eligibility,
      participants will come in for 2 study visits over the course of 6 months which will last
      about 1.5-2 hours. At each visit, a research assistant (RA) will administer a questionnaire
      assessing health behaviors including diet, exercise and medication and quality of life. The
      RAs will also measure height, weight, take 6 BP readings, and send patients to the lab for
      blood and urine samples. After the first clinic visit, participants will be randomized to
      one of three telephone groups. All participants will receive 1 phone call per month for 6
      months which will last approximately 30-40 minutes. 1) The BI group will receive TTM
      stage-matched counseling. The interventionist will assess how ready patients are for change
      in terms of diet, medication, and exercise adherence and deliver a tailored intervention
      discussing adherence barriers. 2) In the BEI, in addition to using the TTM, the intervention
      will tailor environmental factors, such as availability of healthy food stores, recreational
      facilities, and support from caregivers in helping participants follow treatment
      recommendations. We will speak with participant's caregivers to educate them on heart
      failure as well. The caregivers will receive a call every 2 months (3 in total) lasting
      approximately 20-30 minutes. 3) The control group will receive monthly telephone calls
      during which they will receive general health education. Our primary analytic goal is to
      estimate the medication adherence rate and QOL to power a larger study. We will also perform
      1-sample Exact Binomial Tests comparing the active arms to the expected inactive control
      rate of 47%. Since this is a pilot study, we will use a 5% type 1 error rate (2-sided) for
      each test. All analyses will be intent to treat.

    <description>Refill compliance is an objective measurement of medication adherence that utilizes pharmacy records to assess the proportion of time a patient has medication available to take. At the original release of the medication, and each subsequent refill, individuals are given enough medication to last a set number of days. This number is referred to as the &quot;Days Supply&quot; and can be calculated by dividing the number of pills prescribed by the number of pills taken per day. To calculate compliance, the &quot;Days Supply&quot; is subtracted by the number of days between Actual Refill dates, a time span referred to as the &quot;Days Passed&quot;. If the Days Passed exceeds the Days Supply the absolute value of the difference represents the number of days the individual was non-adherent. This absolute value is referred to as a &quot;Gap&quot;. The sum of the Gaps/total number of days passed between the original release of the medication and the final recorded refill date represents non-compliance over that period of time.</description>

        <title>Medication Adherence (Refill Compliance for All HF Medications)</title>
        <description>Refill compliance is an objective measurement of medication adherence that utilizes pharmacy records to assess the proportion of time a patient has medication available to take. At the original release of the medication, and each subsequent refill, individuals are given enough medication to last a set number of days. This number is referred to as the &quot;Days Supply&quot; and can be calculated by dividing the number of pills prescribed by the number of pills taken per day. To calculate compliance, the &quot;Days Supply&quot; is subtracted by the number of days between Actual Refill dates, a time span referred to as the &quot;Days Passed&quot;. If the Days Passed exceeds the Days Supply the absolute value of the difference represents the number of days the individual was non-adherent. This absolute value is referred to as a &quot;Gap&quot;. The sum of the Gaps/total number of days passed between the original release of the medication and the final recorded refill date represents non-compliance over that period of time.</description>

        <title>Adherence to ACE Inhibitors and ARB</title>
        <description>Refill compliance is an objective measurement of medication adherence that utilizes pharmacy records to assess the proportion of time a patient has medication available to take. At the original release of the medication, and each subsequent refill, individuals are given enough medication to last a set number of days. This number is referred to as the &quot;Days Supply&quot; and can be calculated by dividing the number of pills prescribed by the number of pills taken per day. To calculate compliance, the &quot;Days Supply&quot; is subtracted by the number of days between Actual Refill dates, a time span referred to as the &quot;Days Passed&quot;. If the Days Passed exceeds the Days Supply the absolute value of the difference represents the number of days the individual was non-adherent. This absolute value is referred to as a &quot;Gap&quot;. The sum of the Gaps/total number of days passed between the original release of the medication and the final recorded refill date represents non-compliance over that period of time.</description>
