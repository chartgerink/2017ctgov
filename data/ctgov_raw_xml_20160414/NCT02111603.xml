  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' hypothesis is that therapy with Colesevelam, reduces fecal bile acid
      excretion in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)-diarrhea with prior evidence of
      increased fecal 48 hour total bile acid excretion. The investigators aim to study the
      ability of the HPLC assay for fecal bile acids to demonstrate responsiveness after treatment
      with Colesevelam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, is able to reduce
      fecal bile acids and improve bowel function in patients with IBS-diarrhea and Mayo's HPLC
      method can demonstrate a response to the Colesevelam.

      The study design will be a single center, unblinded, single dose trial to study the ability
      to identify the effect of taking 1875 mg (3 tablets [625 mg/tablet]) of Colesevelam orally
      twice daily for ten days on fasting serum 7alphaC4 and total 48 hour fecal bile acid
      excretion. Stool and fasting serum samples will be collected predose and during final 48
      hours' dosing for assessment. Participants will also fill out an 8-day stool diary assessing
      frequency, consistency, ease of passage of bowel movements before and during treatment with
      Colesevelam.

    <description>The subjects rated their stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale. The Bristol Stool Form Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 10 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Stool 48 hour collections (for BAs) were collected during baseline before treatment, and then during days 9-10 of the 10 days of colesevelam dosing for fecal BAs. Relative composition of the main individual bile acids (cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)) in 48 hour stool collection after colesevelam treatment were compared to baseline values.
The concordance correlation coefficient (rc) measures agreement between two variables. The concordance correlation satisfies -1 ≤ rc ≤ +1. A value of rc = +1 corresponds to perfect agreement. A value of rc = -1 corresponds to perfect negative agreement, and a value of rc = 0 corresponds to no agreement.</description>

        <title>Concordance Correlation Coefficients of the Relative Composition of Stool Total and the Main Individual Bile Acids (BA)</title>
        <description>Stool 48 hour collections (for BAs) were collected during baseline before treatment, and then during days 9-10 of the 10 days of colesevelam dosing for fecal BAs. Relative composition of the main individual bile acids (cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)) in 48 hour stool collection after colesevelam treatment were compared to baseline values.
The concordance correlation coefficient (rc) measures agreement between two variables. The concordance correlation satisfies -1 ≤ rc ≤ +1. A value of rc = +1 corresponds to perfect agreement. A value of rc = -1 corresponds to perfect negative agreement, and a value of rc = 0 corresponds to no agreement.</description>
