  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide information on whether subjects with allergic
      rhinitis (AR) prefer the administration of fluticasone furoate (FF) nasal spray or
      mometasone furoate (MF) nasal spray based on how the products feel to the subjects when
      administered.

      This Phase IV interventional study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose,
      cross-over subject preference study to evaluate and compare patient preference for FF
      [(total dose of 110 microgram (mcg)] and MF (total dose of 200 mcg) nasal sprays in subjects
      with allergic rhinitis. These two commonly used nasal sprays use different actuation systems
      (FF nasal spray is side-actuated; MF nasal spray is top-actuated) and this study will
      evaluate whether this difference is reflected in the patient-assessed attributes of the two
      nasal sprays. The attributes or properties which are being assessed by the subjects for
      these nasal sprays include smell, taste &amp; aftertaste, drip down the throat, run out of the
      nose, urge to sneeze, and irritation.

      The single-day study per subject comprises screening and all treatments and procedures.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a cross-over treatment schedule so that all
      subjects receive both products. One group of subjects will have two sprays of FF
      administered in each nostril whilst a second group will have two sprays of MF administered
      into each nostril. At 30 (± 5) minutes after the first study medication treatment, the two
      groups will switch. The first group will then have two sprays of MF administered into each
      nostril and the second group will then have two sprays of FF administered into each nostril.
      After each treatment the subject will complete two sets of attributes questionnaires
      ('immediate' and 'delayed'). A subject-rated 'immediate' attributes questionnaire will be
      completed immediately following each treatment and a subject-rated 'delayed' attributes
      questionnaire will be completed approximately 2 minutes after each treatment. Upon
      completion of the second set of these two attributes questionnaires (immediate and delayed),
      a preference questionnaire will be completed by the subject. In the preference
      questionnaire, the subject states their preferred treatment, if any, for each of the product
      attributes, and finally states their overall preferred treatment, if any.

      There will be follow-up contact with the subject 24 (± 4) and 96 (± 4) hours after
      administration of the last treatment. The study is planned to enroll about 300 subjects.

    <description>An overall preference questionnaire (OPQ) was used to evaluate participants' preference for nasal spray therapy for the given treatments. OPQ allows the responder three options, based on products attributes, i.e. preference for product 1; preference for product 2 and no preference. The OPQ was completed by each participant approximately 4 minutes after administration of the second treatment in Period 2. Overall participant preferences were analyzed using Prescott's test, as approximated by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted for country and symptomatology. All preference p-values were also adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg's method.</description>

Par. specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: very likely; 1: moderately likely; 2: somewhat likely; 3: neither likely nor unlikely; 4: somewhat unlikely; 5; moderately unlikely; 6: very unlikely. Delayed attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with participant as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and Baseline rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of delayed attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg's method.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects who are between 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive at the time
             of signing the informed consent.

          -  Severity of disease: Subjects who meet the below criteria and who may also have
             vasomotor rhinitis are eligible for the study. A positive skin test to perennial (for
             example, but not limited to, animal dander, house dust mites, cockroach, mould) and /
             or seasonal (for example, but not limited to, grass, tree, weed, ragweed) allergen
             within 12 months prior to Screening. If a subject has not been tested in the 12
             months prior to Screening, a positive skin test (by prick method) is required at
             Screening. A positive skin test is defined as a wheal &gt;=3 millimeters (mm) larger
             than the diluent control for prick testing. In vitro tests for specific
             Immunoglobulin E (IgE) [such as radioallergosorbent test (RAST), paper
             radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST)] will not be allowed as a diagnosis of AR.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant [as confirmed by a
             negative urine (preferred) or serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test], not
             lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: (a) Non-reproductive
             potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
             documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
             bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. (b) Reproductive potential and
             agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
             modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of
             reproductive potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication and until at least 4 days after the last dose of study medication.
             The GSK modified list of highly effective methods includes: contraceptive subdermal
             implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria
             including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label;
             Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria
             including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral
             contraceptive; either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable progestogen;
             Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Male partner
             sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry
             into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. This list does
             not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual
             lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from
             penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis.

          -  A male subject is eligible to participate if (a) subjects with female partners of
             child bearing potential comply with the following contraception requirements from the
             time of first dose of study medication until at least 4 days after the last dose of
             study medication; (b) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; (c) Male condom
             plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant
             that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year,
             as stated in the product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets
             the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in
             the product label; Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone,
             Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive
             patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used
             consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is
             responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods
             of contraception.

        <title>Number of Participants With Overall Preference for Nasal Spray Assessed by Preference Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>An overall preference questionnaire (OPQ) was used to evaluate participants’ preference for nasal spray therapy for the given treatments. OPQ allows the responder three options, based on products attributes, i.e. preference for product 1; preference for product 2 and no preference. The OPQ was completed by each participant approximately 4 minutes after administration of the second treatment in Period 2. Overall participant preferences were analyzed using Prescott’s test, as approximated by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted for country and symptomatology. All preference p-values were also adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Immediate Attributes Question Regarding Scent/Odor</title>
        <description>Immediate attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate immediate ratings of participant for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of participants responding to product attributes i.e. scent/odor, using immediate attributes questionnaire, Question 1, “Did product have a scent/odor?” are summarized. The immediate attributes questionnaire was completed immediately following each treatment in Period 1 and 2. Participants specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: none; 1: very mild; 2: mild; 3: neither mild nor strong; 4: slightly strong; 5; moderately strong; 6: very strong. Immediate attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed model with participant as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and Baseline (BL) rhinitis symptomatology subgroup (subgrp), and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of immediate attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Immediate Attributes Question Regarding Satisfaction With Immediate Taste.</title>
        <description>Immediate attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate immediate ratings of par. for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of par. responding to product attributes i.e. taste, using immediate attributes questionnaire, Question 5, “How satisfied with immediate taste?” are summarized. The immediate attributes questionnaire was completed immediately following each treatment in Period 1 and 2. Par. specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: very satisfied; 1: moderately satisfied; 2: somewhat satisfied; 3: neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 4: somewhat dissatisfied; 5; moderately dissatisfied; 6: very dissatisfied. Immediate attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with par. as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and BL rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of immediate attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

        <description>Delayed attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate delayed ratings of par. for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of par. responding to product attributes i.e. scent/odor, using delayed attributes questionnaire, Question 2, “How satisfied with scent/odor?” are summarized. The delayed attributes questionnaire was completed 2 minutes after dosing, in Period 1 and 2. Par. specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: very satisfied; 1: moderately satisfied; 2: somewhat satisfied; 3: neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 4: somewhat dissatisfied; 5; moderately dissatisfied; 6: very dissatisfied. Delayed attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with par. as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and Baseline rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of delayed attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Delayed Attributes Question Regarding Satisfaction With Aftertaste.</title>
        <description>Delayed attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate delayed ratings of par. for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of par. responding to product attributes i.e. taste, using delayed attributes questionnaire, Question 5, “How satisfied with aftertaste?” are summarized. The delayed attributes questionnaire was completed 2 minutes after dosing, in Period 1 and 2. Par. specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: very satisfied; 1: moderately satisfied; 2: somewhat satisfied; 3: neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 4: somewhat dissatisfied; 5; moderately dissatisfied; 6: very dissatisfied. Delayed attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with par. as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and BL rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of delayed attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

            <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Delayed Attributes Question Regarding Smedicine Running Out of Nose.</title>
            <description>Delayed attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate delayed ratings of participant for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of participants responding to product attributes using delayed attributes questionnaire, Question 7, “Did medicine run out of nose?” are summarized. The delayed attributes questionnaire was completed 2 minutes after dosing, in Period 1 and 2. Participants specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: none; 1: very slightly; 2: slightly; 3: neither slightly nor moderately; 4: moderately; 5; markedly; 6: very markedly. Delayed attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with participant as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and Baseline rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of delayed attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>

            <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Delayed Attributes Question Regarding Bothersome Nasal Irritation.</title>
            <description>Delayed attributes questionnaire was used to evaluate delayed ratings of participant for individual attributes of FF and MF nasal spray. Number of participants responding to product attributes using delayed attributes questionnaire, Question 10, “How bothersome was nasal irritation?” are summarized. The delayed attributes questionnaire was completed 2 minutes after dosing, in Period 1 and 2. Participants specified their responses on a 6-point scale: 0: none; 1: very slightly; 2: slightly; 3: neither slightly nor moderately; 4: moderately; 5; markedly; 6: very markedly. Delayed attribute ratings were analyzed using an analysis of variance mixed model with participant as a random effect, and country, treatment, period, and Baseline rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. P-values associated with tests of delayed attribute rating scores were adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s method.</description>
