      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Olopatadine Nasal Spray with
      Azelastine Nasal Spray when treatments are utilized in conjunction with Fluticasone Nasal
      Spray for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

    <description>Responses to patient-completed diaries for reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS). TNSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included runny nose, itchy nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are then added together for a composite score (TNSS score), the maximum of which could be 12 . Reflective scores were assessed from the hour since the last dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Scores (iTNSS) From Baseline</title>
        <description>Responses to patient-completed diaries for instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Scores (iTNSS). TNSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included runny nose, itchy nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are then added together for a composite score (TNSS score), the maximum of which could be 12 . Instantaneous scores were assessed at the time of daily dosing.</description>
        <time_frame>14 days minus baseline</time_frame>
        <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
        <population>The analysis was per protocol. 15 patients were not included in the analysis.</population>
