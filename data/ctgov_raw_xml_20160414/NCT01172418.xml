    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to determine which antibody induction regimen will
      result in a safer and more effective method to use with steroid avoidance in renal
      transplant recipients. Patients receiving either first cadaveric or non-HLA identical living
      donor kidney transplants will be preoperatively randomized into 2 groups.

      Antibody Induction:

      Group I: Our standard steroid avoidance protocol, i.e., 3 daily doses of 1 mg/kg of
      Thymoglobulin®, the first to be infused at surgery, accompanied by 2 doses of anti-CD25
      humanized monoclonal antibody, the first also to be given at surgery, and the second 2 weeks
      later. (controls) Group II: A new steroid avoidance protocol in which 1 dose of 1 mg/kg of
      Thymoglobulin® is to be infused at surgery followed by 1 dose of alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) at
      0.3 mg/kg within 24 hours. No further antibody therapy will be used.

      In both groups, Prograf® maintenance therapy will be rapidly initiated (vide-infra) with a
      targeting dosage to 12 hour trough levels of 4 to 8 ng/ml.

      In Group I, maintenance dosing Myfortic® will be targeted to 720 mg twice daily. In Group
      II, maintenance doses of Myfortic® will be targeted to 360 mg twice daily.

      Steroids are to be given equivalently in both groups only during the first week
      postoperatively. The regimen consists of 500 mg/day of Solumedrol intravenously for 3
      postoperative days followed by daily oral methylprednisolone or IV Solumedrol at 1 mg/kg per
      day, decreasing to 0.5 mg/kg per day during the remainder of the week primarily to avoid
      hypersensitivity reactions to the induction antibodies. No further steroid use is planned.
