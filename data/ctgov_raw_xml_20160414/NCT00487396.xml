      The aim of this study is to validate the ability of Capsule Endoscopy (CE) to accurately
      diagnose small bowel (SB) Crohns disease in patients with symptoms of abdominal pain and
      diarrhea.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether Capsule Endoscopy prior to
      colonoscopy will improve diagnosis in patients with suspected Crohns disease when compared
      to standard diagnostic testing.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic, inflammatory disorder(IBD) affecting any part of the
      gastrointestinal tract but frequently involves the small and large bowel. (1,2,3) Typical
      presenting symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea. (1,2,3) Patients with this disorder
      may also have extraintestinal manifestations including arthritis, uveitis and aphthous
      stomatitis, erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum.(1,2) The etiology of Crohn's disease
      is unknown. It affects populations around the globe and occurs at any age but it has a
      predilection to affect those between the ages of 15 and 35. (1,2,3,4) While about one half
      of patients have involvement of the ileum and large bowel, another third have disease
      isolated to the small bowel. (1,2) Frequently, small bowel Crohn's disease can be difficult
      to diagnose using the traditional methods of evaluation including colonoscopy with ileoscopy
      and contrast radiography.(1,2) Mucosal features of Crohn's disease are often subtle and
      difficult to identify by small bowel follow through (SBFT). The SBFT has traditionally been
      relied on to evaluate the small intestine for evidence of Crohn's disease but it has been
      shown to have a relatively low accuracy of only 30%. (5,6,7,8,9,) This has led to delays in
      the diagnosis of Crohn's disease with reports ranging from one to three years.(7,8,9) In the
      past few years, capsule endoscopy has sparked renewed interest in the investigation of IBD
      and Crohn's disease of the small bowel. A PillCam™ SB2 capsule (Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam,
      Israel) is an ingestible, disposable video camera that transmits high quality images of the
      small intestinal mucosa. This enables the small intestine to be readily accessible to
      physicians investigating for the presence of small bowel disorders which in the past was
      inaccessible to physicians.(7,9,10,11,12) A number of small pilot studies demonstrated
      capsule endoscopy efficacy in diagnosing SB Crohn's disease. Diagnostic yields of 70% have
      been reported in small series of studies performed in suspected small bowel Crohn's
      disease.( 9,10,11,12) This study is designed to determine the yield and clinical impact of
      Capsule Endoscopy in detecting suspected IBD and suspected Crohn's Disease of the small
      bowel when compared to SBFT. (6,7,8,9,10)

1 patient withdrew consent before any study procedure.
1 patient could not ingest the capsule.
1 patient refused to undergo the ileocolonoscopy and SBFT. Therefore 80 patients were included in the analysis</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Number of Positive Findings, Detected by Each Modality, Which Were Considered by the Investigator to be Crohn's Disease Related</title>
        <description>The number of positive findings related to Crohn that were detected by capsule endoscopy procedure and ileo-colonoscopy as compared to the number of findings related to Crohn that were detected by ileo-colonoscopy and small bowel follow through(SBFT) procedures.</description>

        <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
        <population>Findings were catagorized (ulcers, inflammatory lesions, stricturing lesions and others) and for each category, the numbers of found and missed pathologies, i.e. the detection capabilities, were calculated for the combination of the procedures (i.e. CE and IC vs. SBFT and IC) and were limited to one count per location (SB, terminal ileum, colon).</population>
