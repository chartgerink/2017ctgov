  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prazosin will:

        -  reduce the incidence of nightmares and sleep disturbance

        -  increase functioning and sense of well being in combat-trauma exposed Operation Iraqi
           Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) Veterans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 15-week randomized parallel design, double-blind, placebo-controlled augmentation
      trial of prazosin to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prazosin augmentation in the
      treatment of PTSD trauma-related nightmares, sleep disturbance, global function and sense of
      well-being, and other clinical features and comorbidities of PTSD. Participants will be 210
      OIF/OEF soldiers and veterans who have suffered war zone trauma. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to prazosin or placebo and all previous psychotropic medications and/or
      psychotherapy will be maintained constant. Randomization will be stratified by site and use
      of an antidepressant.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Item B-2 &quot;recurrent distressing dreams of the event&quot; is a single item from the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. The rating consists of two parts: Frequency and Intensity. Symptom frequency rated 0 to 4. Symptom intensity rated 0 to 4. Frequency plus Intensity ratings equal the total score. A higher score is worse; a lower score is better. This outcome measure evaluates the change in score from Baseline to Week 15.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire assessing sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. A global score is obtained by summing the seven component subscales (total score range: 0-21). A score of 5 or less indicates good sleep quality. A score of more than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. Change is measured from Baseline to Week 15.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 15</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change is a 7-point scale that rates global change compared to baseline (1=markedly improved, 2=moderately improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=moderately worse, 7=markedly worse). The CGIC is used to determine the impact of treat effects on meaningful and distinct change in overall sense of well-being and functioning. This outcome measures the proportion of responders who were rated markedly or moderately improved at Week 15 compared to Baseline.</description>

        <description>Item B-2 &quot;recurrent distressing dreams of the event&quot; is a single item from the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. The rating consists of two parts: Frequency and Intensity. Symptom frequency rated 0 to 4. Symptom intensity rated 0 to 4. Frequency plus Intensity ratings equal the total score. A higher score is worse; a lower score is better. This outcome measure evaluates the change in score from Baseline to Week 15.</description>

        <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire assessing sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. A global score is obtained by summing the seven component subscales (total score range: 0-21). A score of 5 or less indicates good sleep quality. A score of more than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. Change is measured from Baseline to Week 15.</description>

The CGIC is used to determine the impact of treat effects on meaningful and distinct change in overall sense of well-being and functioning. This outcome measures the proportion of responders who were rated markedly or moderately improved at Week 15 compared to Baseline.</description>
