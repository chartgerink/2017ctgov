Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Congenital abnormality or birth defect

    <description>After enrollment in the pharmacokinetic period, patients were maintained on their usual dose of tacrolimus twice daily on Day 1 through Day 14 and on Day 15 were converted to tacrolimus modified release (MR) once-daily in the morning for 14 days, converted back to tacrolimus twice daily for 14 days and then converted back to tacrolimus MR formulation once-daily in the morning for 14 days, all based on a 1:1 mg for mg total daily dose conversion. The extended treatment period began on day 57 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus extended-release formulation once every morning through the end of the study.
Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain the target tacrolimus trough level within the range of 5 to 20 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

        <description>Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) is defined as an episode of acute liver allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ I. Biopsies were graded by the pathologist at the clinical site according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading of acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I (Mild): Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II (Moderate): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III (Severe): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.</description>

            <description>Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) is defined as an episode of acute liver allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ I. Biopsies were graded by the pathologist at the clinical site according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading of acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I (Mild): Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II (Moderate): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III (Severe): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect or other untoward medical occurrence, regardless of the relationship to study drug which occurred during the conduct of a clinical study. Clinically significant adverse changes in clinical status, routine laboratory studies or physical examinations were considered adverse events.
A serious adverse event was any adverse event occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Congenital abnormality or birth defect

The extended treatment period began on day 57 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus extended-release formulation once every morning through the end of the study.
Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain the target tacrolimus trough level within the range of 5 to 20 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>
