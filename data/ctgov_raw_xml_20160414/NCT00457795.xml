    <description>IOP for a 24-hour period separated into diurnal(7AM-11PM or awake period) and nocturnal (11PM-7AM or sleep period) at week 4. IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. Measurements of IOP were taken in the sitting and supine (laying down face up) body positions during the 16-hour diurnal (awake) period and in the supine position during the 8-hour nocturnal (sleep) period.</description>

            <title>Ocular Perfusion Pressure (OPP) for a 24-Hour Period at Week 4</title>
            <description>Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) calculated for a 24-hour period separated into diurnal (7AM-11PM or awake period) and nocturnal (11PM-7AM or sleep period) at week 4. Ocular perfusion pressure is blood pressure minus the intraocular pressure, which is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. Measurements of IOP and blood pressure were taken in the sitting and supine (laying down face up) body positions during the 16-hour diurnal (awake) period and in the supine position during the 8-hour nocturnal (sleep) period.</description>
