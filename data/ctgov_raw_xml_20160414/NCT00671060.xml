  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test - in a randomized, blinded trial - two
      different doses of the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol administered buccally as a
      treatment for fetal death at 14 - 28 weeks, inclusive, of pregnancy. At such an advanced
      stage of pregnancy, the nonviable fetus is often not spontaneously evacuated, and yet timely
      evacuation is vital in order to avoid the possibility of, among other things, potentially
      life-threatening maternal coagulopathies. Current approaches to uterine evacuation in these
      cases include dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E) surgery (in less advanced pregnancies) and
      labor induction with a variety of products. Misoprostol has been demonstrated to be as
      effective as, or more effective than, either oxytocin or prostaglandin E2 analogues for this
      indication in a number of small, non-FDA-approved trials which have been published in the
      peer-reviewed literature. In the absence of more formal study of this treatment, however,
      dosages are not standardized, pathways of administration vary, and other uncertainties
      linger. The purpose of the protocol proposed herein is to formally establish, via a
      randomized, double-blinded study, the safety and effectiveness of misoprostol for this
      indication, and to compare the value of two distinct doses, so that providers may
      henceforward proceed with greater authority and confidence.

            <groups_desc>Rates of success were compared across study arms. The study was a separate, non-comparative efficacy study. In order to have 80% power (alpha=.05) to demonstrate that each misoprostol regimen was 95%, ± 5%, effective, we enrolled 73 women in each arm of the study, or 146 women total. The sample size also provided 80% power (alpha=.05) to detect a significant difference between treatments should 200μg prove 98% effective and 100μg prove 88% effective.</groups_desc>
