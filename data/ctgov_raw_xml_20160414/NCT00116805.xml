  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF, tenofovir DF) compared to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for the treatment of
      HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Participants will receive either TDF or the approved
      hepatitis B therapy ADV. After 48 weeks all participants will be switched to open-label TDF.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of TDF versus ADV will be evaluated for histologic improvement, reductions in serum
      HBV DNA, changes in liver enzymes, and the generation of antibody to the virus. Safety will
      be assessed by evaluating adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and the development of
      drug-resistant mutations. After 48 weeks, all participants will receive open-label TDF, and
      the efficacy and safety of TDF will be monitored for the remainder of the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</description>

            <description>Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.</description>
