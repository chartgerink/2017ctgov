    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary anemia that causes the red blood cells to change
      their shape from a round and doughnut-like shape to a half-moon/crescent, or sickled shape.
      People who have SCD have a different type of hemoglobin (protein that carries oxygen). This
      different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into a crescent shape under
      certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the
      blood vessels blocking the flow of blood and can cause inflammation and injury to important
      areas of the body. All babies are born with hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Soon
      after birth, HbF production slows down and another hemoglobin called adult hemoglobin (HbA)
      is made. Clinical studies have shown that increasing the amount of HbF in the blood may
      prevent sickling of the red blood cells. Vorinostat has been used in the treatment of
      cancers and in other research studies and information from those suggests that it may help
      treat SCD by increasing the amount of HbF in the blood. The purpose of this research study
      is to determine the effectiveness and safety of vorinostat when used to treat SCD.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), when
           administered orally, in a pulsed fashion, once-a-day for 3 consecutive days every week,
           in inducing a 4% absolute increase or a 100% increase in fetal hemoglobin percent
           levels (HbF%) in subjects with severe sickle cell disease who have failed prior
           therapy.

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of vorinostat on F-cell levels.

        -  To determine the changes in y-globin, B-globin and E-globin RNA levels during treatment
           with vorinostat.

        -  To describe the dose-response characteristics of vorinostat in inducing fetal
           hemoglobin in sickle cell disease.

      Exploratory

        -  To determine the extent and duration of global histone acetylation with intermittent
           vorinostat dosing.

        -  To correlate the status of polymorphisms near the BCL11A, c-myb, and HBB gene loci, all
           of which are associated with levels of fetal hemoglobin, to assess for an association
           of polymorphism status with therapeutic response to vorinostat.

        -  To evaluate red blood cell rheology before and after treatment with vorinostat.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This was a single stage design to evaluate induction of HbF on treatment with target
      enrollment of 15 patients. A 25% success rate was considered evidence of activity in this
      patient population while 5% success rate deemed ineffective. If at least 3 patients achieved
      success, the treatment would be considered promising. With 15 eligible patients, the
      probability of observing this was 0.76 assuming a true rate of 25% and 0.04 assuming a true
      rate of 5%.

    <description>Success will be defined by comparing the maximum HbF% on study drug to the HbF% at baseline. An absolute increase in HbF% of 4% of more, or an increase to 100% or more of baseline in patients with HbF under 4% at baseline will be considered a success. HbF% induction success rate is calculated as the count of successes divided by the count of particpants in the analysis population.</description>

      <time_frame>Assessed weekly throughout treatment from time of first dose and up to day 30 post-treatment. Median duration of treatment was 3 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious AEs were defined as events with treatment-attribution of possibly, probably or definitely and grade 3 or higher per CTCAEv3. Other AEs were defined as events with treatment-attribution of possible, probable or definite and grades 1 or 2 per CTCAEv3. Maximum grade toxicity by type was calculated within each group.</desc>

          <title>Vorinostat</title>
          <description>Patients received vorinostat in a pulsed fashion, once a day for 3 consecutive days every week to a maximum dose of 400 mg per dose (1200 mg/wk), for 12 to 16 weeks at the maximum dose. The first 3 patients were enrolled in an intrapatient dose escalation schedule of 100 mg/d, then 200 mg/d, each for 3 consecutive days a week for 4 weeks, and then 400 mg/d, 3 consecutive days per week for 16 weeks. The last 2 patients were enrolled to receive 400 mg/d, 3 consecutive days per week for 12 weeks, without an initial dose escalation.</description>
