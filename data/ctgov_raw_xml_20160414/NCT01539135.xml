  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients have an endotracheal tube inserted into their windpipe to help them
      breathe while under general anesthesia. These tubes have a &quot;cuff&quot; on the outside that is
      inflated in the trachea to help prevent fluids from leaking into the lungs. These cuffs come
      in different shapes and sizes. The TaperGuard endotracheal tube has a taper-shaped cuff that
      has been shown in animals to decrease the leakage of fluid past the cuff better than a
      traditional tube that has a barrel-shaped cuff. This study is designed to examine whether
      the use of the TaperGuard tube during surgery on humans decreases the amount of leakage past
      the cuff to a greater degree than the traditional barrel-shaped cuff. In addition, the study
      will investigate whether the use of the TaperGuard tube is associated with a decrease in
      respiratory complications often seen following surgery which may be related to fluid leaking
      past the cuff and into the lungs. It is thought that the use of the TaperGuard endotracheal
      tube will result in a decrease in fluid leakage past the cuff and that it will be associated
      with a decrease in respiratory complications during the 30 days after surgery.

      This study is designed to yield data on the intraoperative use of TaperGuardâ„¢endotracheal
      tubes and its potential influence on postoperative pulmonary complications and outcomes. The
      TaperGuard Basic tube has a taper-shaped cuff and has been shown, via bench and animal
      testing, to decrease microaspiration, which has been associated with respiratory
      difficulties. The intraoperative use of this tube (i.e. during short term intubation), and
      its impact on postoperative complications and outcomes has not been investigated. This study
      will determine whether the intraoperative use of the TaperGuard tube results in a decrease
      in microaspiration compared to the Hi-Lo endotracheal tube having a barrel-shaped cuff.
      Moreover, the relationship between a decrease in microaspiration and subsequent decrease in
      postoperative respiratory complications will be explored.
