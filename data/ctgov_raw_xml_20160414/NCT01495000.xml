    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density at the Lumbar Spine at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine was measured by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. The mean percent change from Baseline in BMD was calculated as: (value at Month 6 minus Baseline value) * 100 / Baseline value. Analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms for treatment and baseline BMD at the lumbar spine (as a continuous covariate).</description>

    <description>BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter was measured by the DXA scanner. The mean percent change from Baseline in BMD was calculated as: (value at Month 6 minus Baseline value) * 100 / Baseline value. Analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with terms for treatment and corresponding Baseline BMD (as a continuous covariate).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of s-CTx and s-PINP, which are used as biomarkers of bone resorption and formation, respectively. The median percent change from Baseline in s-CTX and s-PINP markers at Months 1, 3, and 6 was calculated as: (post-Baseline value minus Baseline value) * 100 / Baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia. Medical or scientific judgment was to have been exercised in other important medical events. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <description>Vital sign values of potential clinical concern were defined as: change in heart rate &gt;30 beats per minutes (bpm), change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), and change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;20 mmHg. The number of participants with post-Baseline vital sign values of potential clinical concern who did not have values of potential clinical concern at Baseline are summarized. If the change from Baseline is a decrease greater than the threshold, it is categorized as &quot;low.&quot; If the change from Baseline is an increase greater than the threshold, it is categorized ad &quot;high.&quot;</description>

The mean percent change from Baseline in BMD was calculated as: (value at Month 6 minus Baseline value) * 100 / Baseline value.

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia. Medical or scientific judgment was to have been exercised in other important medical events. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>
