    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective trial with 6-month follow up. A non-inferiority
      hypothesis is tested. A new developed treatment and education programme for type 1 diabetic
      patients (PRIMAS) will be tested compared to an established treatment and education
      programme (German DTTP). Primary outcome variable is glycemic control at 6-month follow up.
      Secondary outcome variables are: diabetes knowledge, diabetes related distress, depressive
      symptoms, diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behavior, attitudes towards diabetes and insulin
      treatment, hypoglycemia awareness.

      Both programmes consists of 12 lessons with a length of 90 minutes. Eligible type 1 diabetic
      patients in a diabetologist practice are pooled and randomised either to the new developed
      PRIMAS programme or to an established education programme for type 1 diabetic patients (DTTP
      - Treatment and education programme for intensified insulin treatment) as an active
      comparator.

    <measure>Diabetes Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess knowledge among insulin-treated diabetes patients, participants completed a new developed 11-item diabetes knowledge score. Each item had to be answered by selecting the correct answer from multiple choices. The numbers of correct answers are summed up; thus, the range of the diabetes knowledge score is between 0 and 11.</description>

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire provides a score indicating the severity of hypoglycaemia unawareness. This scale ranges from 0 (maximum hypoglycaemia awareness) to 7 (minimum hypoglycaemia awareness), where a score of 4 suggests reduced hypoglycaemia awareness.</description>

    <time_frame>6 Month Follow up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Satisfaction with current diabetes treatment was assessed by a diabetes satisfaction questionnaire developed by Kulzer et al. This questionnaire uncovers problems in dealing with diabetes, also. A high score indicates dissatisfaction with insulin therapy.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the Diabetes Education Course</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients satisfaction with the diabetes education programs was assessed using a self-constructed 12-item scale on specific questions regarding contents and performance of the training. Response mode was a scale ranging from 4 (apply very strong) to 0 (apply not at all). Additionally, patients were asked to give an overall grade for their course ranging from 1 (very good) to 6 (unsatisfactory).</description>
