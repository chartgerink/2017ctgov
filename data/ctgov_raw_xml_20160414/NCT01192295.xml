    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl)
      controlled-release (CR) tablets in opioid tolerant pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years,
      inclusive, with moderate to severe malignant and/or nonmalignant pain requiring opioid
      therapy.

    <measure>The Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (during the study) and 7-10 days poststudy (safety follow-up assessment).</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety assessments consisted of reports of AEs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, pulse oximetry (SpO2), and somnolence assessments. Safety variables were summarized descriptively within age group for the safety population.</description>

    <measure>Pain Right Now Assessment by Patients Aged 6 to &lt; 12 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain right now was assessed by patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years using the Faces of Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The FPS-R is a horizontal row of 6 faces representing pain intensity, with &quot;no hurt&quot; at the far left and &quot;hurts worst&quot; at the far right; the 6 intensities are scored as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 (the patient was not shown the numbers associated with the faces). A score of 0 means no pain, and a 10 means very much pain. Pain right now was assessed by the patient at screening; after the first dose; and, thereafter, twice daily during the AM and PM, approximately at the time of each (morning and evening) dose of oxycodone HCl CR tablets during the study treatment.</description>

    <measure>Pain Right Now Assessment by Patients Aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain right now was assessed by patients aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 years using the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The 100-mm VAS is a 100-mm line with 1 end marked &quot;no pain&quot; and the opposite end marked as &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot; The patient was asked to make a mark on that line indicating his or her level of pain. The pain right now 100-mm VAS score was defined as the distance (in mm) from the &quot;no pain&quot; end to the patient's mark. The scale is measured on a 100 mm line: a 0 means no pain and bigger numbers indicate more pain. Pain right now was assessed by the patient at screening; after the first dose; and, thereafter, twice daily during the AM and PM, approximately at the time of each (morning and evening) dose of oxycodone HCl CR tablets during the study treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Supplemental Pain Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Supplemental opioid and nonopioid pain medications were permitted during the study as deemed appropriate by the investigator. The dose of supplemental analgesic medication allowed was at the discretion of the investigator and within appropriate dose ranges for age and weight.</description>

    <measure>Parent/ Caregiver-Assessed Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4 or early discontinuation</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The PGIC rating score variable was collected on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7 (where 1 = very much improved; and 7 = very much worse). The PGIC is designed to assess overall satisfaction with the treatment. The number and percent of parent/caregivers reporting each category of PGIC response at the final visit was summarized for the safety population within age group.</description>

    <measure>Parent/ Caregiver Assessed Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) for Patients Aged 6 to &lt; 12 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The FDI is a validated tool used to evaluate the degree to which children have reduced physical and psychosocial functioning because of their pain difficulties in the previous 2 weeks. The FDI comprises 15 items. Responses to each item were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. The individual scores are: (0) no trouble, (1) a little trouble, (2) some trouble, (3) a lot of trouble, and (4) impossible. A total score (ranging from 0 to 60) for the 15 items was calculated, with lower scores indicating less functional disability. The FDI was performed by the parent/ caregiver.</description>

    <description>Plasma concentration data were characterized for a population PK model of oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets in opioid tolerant pediatric patients. Plasma samples were collected after the first dose on day 1 (one sample 2 to 4 hours after the dose and 1 sample 4 to 6 hours after the dose with approximately 2 hours between the samples), and immediately predose (morning or evening dose) and 2 to 4 hours after that dose at visit 2 and/or visit 3; a total of 4 to 6 samples were collected.</description>

             side effects [eg, nausea, constipation]).

          -  Patients who have received epidural opioids &lt; 2 hours prior to the first dose of
             study drug or who have received epidural morphine &lt; 12 hours prior to the first dose

        <title>Pain Right Now Assessment by Patients Aged 6 to &lt; 12 Years</title>
        <description>Pain right now was assessed by patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years using the Faces of Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The FPS-R is a horizontal row of 6 faces representing pain intensity, with “no hurt” at the far left and “hurts worst” at the far right; the 6 intensities are scored as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 (the patient was not shown the numbers associated with the faces). A score of 0 means no pain, and a 10 means very much pain. Pain right now was assessed by the patient at screening; after the first dose; and, thereafter, twice daily during the AM and PM, approximately at the time of each (morning and evening) dose of oxycodone HCl CR tablets during the study treatment.</description>

        <title>Pain Right Now Assessment by Patients Aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 Years</title>
        <description>Pain right now was assessed by patients aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 years using the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The 100-mm VAS is a 100-mm line with 1 end marked “no pain” and the opposite end marked as “pain as bad as it could be.” The patient was asked to make a mark on that line indicating his or her level of pain. The pain right now 100-mm VAS score was defined as the distance (in mm) from the “no pain” end to the patient’s mark. The scale is measured on a 100 mm line: a 0 means no pain and bigger numbers indicate more pain. Pain right now was assessed by the patient at screening; after the first dose; and, thereafter, twice daily during the AM and PM, approximately at the time of each (morning and evening) dose of oxycodone HCl CR tablets during the study treatment.</description>

        <description>The FDI is a validated tool used to evaluate the degree to which children have reduced physical and psychosocial functioning because of their pain difficulties in the previous 2 weeks. The FDI comprises 15 items. Responses to each item were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. The individual scores are: (0) no trouble, (1) a little trouble, (2) some trouble, (3) a lot of trouble, and (4) impossible. A total score (ranging from 0 to 60) for the 15 items was calculated, with lower scores indicating less functional disability. The FDI was performed by the parent/ caregiver.</description>
