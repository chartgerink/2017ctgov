  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if outpatients with bipolar mania
      who are partially nonresponsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy can achieve stable
      symptoms on a combination treatment of aripiprazole plus lithium or valproate.

It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself.

The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.</description>

    <description>The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of parkinsonian symptomatology. It is the most commonly used rating scale for Parkinsonism in clinical trials over the past 25 years. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point. The total SAS Score has a possible range from 10 to 50(lower scores=less severe). Negative change scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <description>The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.</description>

Seven items are rated on a 0 to 4 scale, while 4 items (items 5, 6, 8 and 9) are rated on a 0 to 8 scale (twice the weight of the other items.) For all items, 0 is the “best” rating and 4 or 8 is the “worst” rating. Total Score is the sum of the ratings for all 11 items. The possible Total Scores are from 0 to 60.</description>

        <description>Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar (CGI-BP) assesses global illness severity and change from baseline in patients with bipolar disorder. Patients are rated on mania, depression and overall bipolar illness items on a 7-point scale [1 to 7], with 1 being normal and 7 being very severely ill). A negative change score signifies improvement.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants Not Experiencing Relapse of Depressive Episode Through Week 52 During Phase 3</title>
        <description>Kaplan Meier estimated survival rate. Relapse is defined as any of the following events accompanied by a YMRS &gt; 16 and/or a MADRS &gt; 16; serious adverse event of worsening disease, or discontinuation by the investigator for lack of efficacy. A hospitalization for a manic, mixed, or depressive episode does meet the criteria for relapse, however does not require an accompanying Y-MRS and/or MADRS score &gt; 16.</description>

            <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. MADRS total score, a 10-item, ordinal rating scale (0=no symptoms; 60=most severe symptoms). Change from baseline=postbaseline score - baseline score.

        <description>HOMA stands for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and beta-cell function. These are model-based calculations that use fasting insulin and glucose concentrations in order to assess pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance. The HOMA2 model assesses beta-cell function (HOMA2-%β) relative to expected normal function (indexed to 100% for normal function) and is based on predictions from experimental human data on the relationship between insulin and glucose in a fasted state. HOMA2-%Beta is a percentage of ‘normal function.’</description>

        <title>Baseline Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)</title>
        <description>The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.</description>

            <title>Unadjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) at Phase 2 Endpoint</title>
            <description>The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.</description>

        <title>Baseline in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of parkinsonian symptomatology. It is the most commonly used rating scale for Parkinsonism in clinical trials over the past 25 years. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point. The total SAS Score has a possible range from 10 to 50.(lower score=less severe). Negative change scores indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>HOMA stands for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and beta-cell function. These are model-based calculations that use fasting insulin and glucose concentrations in order to assess pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance. The HOMA2 model assesses beta-cell function (HOMA2-%β) relative to expected normal function (indexed to 100% for normal function) and is based on predictions from experimental human data on the relationship between insulin and glucose in a fasted state. HOMA2-%Beta is a percentage of ‘normal function.’</description>

        <description>The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of parkinsonian symptomatology. It is the most commonly used rating scale for Parkinsonism in clinical trials over the past 25 years. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point. The total SAS Score has a possible range from 10 to 50(lower scores=less severe). Negative change scores indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). The AIMS Total Score has a possible range from 0 to 28. Negative change scores indicate improvement in movement dysfunction.</description>

        <description>The AIMS is an assessment of movement dysfunctions. It is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs and 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in 3 main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). AIMS Item 9 Score range from 0 to 4. A negative score signifies improvement.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Global Clinical Assessment During Phase 3</title>
        <description>The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is a 4-item scale to assess presence and severity of drug-induced akathisia, including both objective items and subjective items, together with a global clinical assessment of akathisia. Global assessment is made on a scale of 0 to 5 with comprehensive definitions provided for each anchor point on scale: 0=absent; 1=questionable; 2=mild akathisia; 3=moderate akathisia; 4=marked akathisia; 5=severe akathisia. Score has a possible range from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe akathisia). Negative change scores indicate improvement in akathisia.</description>
