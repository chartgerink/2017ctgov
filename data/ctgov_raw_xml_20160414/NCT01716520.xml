      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lung function response to UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI
      in individual patients using a cross-over design. This is a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, 3-way crossover study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to a sequence of
      UMEC 62.5mcg, VI 25mcg, and UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg. All subjects will receive each treatment
      once-daily for 14 days, and each treatment will be separated by a 10-14 day washout period.
      There will be a 5-7 day run-in period prior to randomization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Obtained Post-dose at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period (TP) by Response Type</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14 of each treatment period (up to study day 83)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM FEV1 was calculated using 0-6 hour post-dose measurements at Day 14 of each TP, which included pre-dose (trough value for Day 14 [mean of the 23 and 24 hour assessments post Day 13 dosing]) and post-dose 15 minutes (min), 30 min, and 1, 3, and 6 hours. BL is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the Day 14 value minus the BL value for that TP. Participants could have been classified as responders to both UMEC and VI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants (Par.) Who Were Responsive to UMEC/VI, UMEC, or VI According to FEV1 at Day 1 of Each Treatment Period (TP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and 0-6 hours post-dose (15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 3, and 6 hours post-dose) on Day 1 of each treatment period (up to study day 71)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A responder is a par. with an increase from BL of &gt;=12% and 200 milliliters (mL) at &gt;=1 time point over 0-6 hours post-dose (PD) in FEV1 on Day 1. A non-responder (NR) is a par. with &gt;=1 FEV1 assessment over 0-6 hours PD on Day 1 but no increase from BL of &gt;=12% and 200 mL at any assessment(s). Missing: no FEV1 data recorded over 0-6 hours PD on Day 1. Response type is defined based on a par.'s response to each individual monotherapy treatment. A responder to UMEC is a par. who is a responder in the UMEC treatment period (TP) and either a NR or has missing data in the VI TP. A responder to VI is a par. who is a responder in the VI TP and either a NR or has missing data in the UMEC TP. A responder to UMEC and VI is a par. who is a responder in both the UMEC and VI TPs. A responder to neither is a par. who is a NR in both the UMEC and VI TPs. Missing: a par. who has missing data in both the UMEC and VI TPs, or who has missing data in one monotherapy period and is a NR in the other.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Larger Change From Baseline in 0-6 Hour Weighted Mean FEV1 at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period With UMEC/VI Compared With UMEC and VI Alone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14 of each treatment period (up to study day 83)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The number of participants with a larger change from Baseline in weighted mean FEV1 with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC and VI alone was recorded. Participants who improved on UMEC/VI had a larger change from Baseline difference in 0-6 hour weighted mean FEV1 on Day 14 on UMEC/VI compared to UMEC or VI alone. Baseline is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Change from Baseline for each treatment period is the Day 14 value minus the Baseline value for that treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 on Day 15 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15 of each treatment period (up to study day 84)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 15 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 14. Analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of treatment, period, mean Baseline (BL), period BL, response type, and treatment by response type interaction. A participant is a reponder to UMEC if they were a responder to UMEC monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy and VI monotherapy. A participant is a responder to VI if they were a responder to VI monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy or VI monotherapy. BL is the mean FEV1 recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between BL and the mean BL in each treatment period for each participant. Change from BL for each treatment period is the Day 15 value minus the BL value for that treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Obtained Post-dose at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period (TP) by Response Type</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM FEV1 was calculated using 0-6 hour post-dose measurements at Day 14 of each TP, which included pre-dose (trough value for Day 14 [mean of the 23 and 24 hour assessments post Day 13 dosing]) and post-dose 15 minutes (min), 30 min, and 1, 3, and 6 hours. BL is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the Day 14 value minus the BL value for that TP. Participants could have been classified as responders to both UMEC and VI.</description>

Analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of treatment, period, mean Baseline (BL), period BL, response type, and treatment by response type interaction. A participant is a reponder to UMEC if they were a responder to UMEC monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy and VI monotherapy. A participant is a responder to VI if they were a responder to VI monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy or VI monotherapy. BL is the mean FEV1 recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between BL and the mean BL in each treatment period for each participant.
