  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin lispro is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      diabetes mellitus. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is approved by the FDA as an
      aid to the absorption and dispersion of other injectable drugs. In this study, rHuPH20
      combined with a non-preserved (NP) formulation of regular human insulin (INSULIN-PH20 NP)
      will be compared to insulin lispro with respect to absorption and action of insulin.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of INSULIN-PH20 NP
      versus insulin lispro alone.

    <measure>Postprandial Glucose Excursion</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14 and Week 26</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A 2-hour postprandial glucose excursion was measured for 3 meals over 3 days during each treatment cycle (3 days during Week 14 of the first treatment cycle and 3 days during Week 26 of the second treatment cycle). For each of the 3 days, the mealtime (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) excursions were calculated as the post-meal glucose value minus the pre-meal value as determined by 8-point glucose monitoring. The average of all excursions over the 3 days for the corresponding treatment cycle is presented.</description>

    <description>Participants were provided a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, consisting of a sensor, transmitter, and receiver. Total time the participant's blood glucose was outside the 71-139 mg/dL range during 3 days of CGM during each treatment cycle (3 days during Week 14 of the first treatment cycle and 3 days during Week 26 of the second treatment cycle) is presented.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with at least one hypoglycemic event (HE) reported during the entire study is presented. Additionally, the number of participants with severe HEs (those that necessitated administration of carbohydrate or glucagon, or resuscitation, by another person) is also presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <description>All enrolled participants underwent a 1-month dose titration period and received 100 units per milliliter (U/mL) insulin lispro, injected subcutaneously (SC) pre-meals, with doses titrated to each participant individually.
Next participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study treatments (Treatment A or B) for the first of two, 3-month treatment cycles. Each participant then received the second treatment for the second cycle.
INSULIN-PH20 NP (Treatment A): 100 U/mL non-preserved (NP) formulation of regular human insulin with 5.0 micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL) recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, injected SC, pre-meals, doses titrated to each participant individually.
Insulin Lispro (Treatment B): 100 U/mL insulin lispro, injected SC, pre-meals, doses titrated to each participant individually.
Throughout the study, participants requiring basal insulin used twice daily SC injections of 100 U/mL insulin glargine or maintained their usual regimen through an insulin pump.</description>

          <description>Following a 1-month titration period, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study treatments (Treatment A or B) for the first of two, 3-month treatment cycles. Each participant then received the second treatment for the second cycle.
INSULIN-PH20 NP (Treatment A): 100 U/mL non-preserved (NP) formulation of regular human insulin with 5.0 micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL) recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, injected SC, pre-meals, doses titrated to each participant individually.
Insulin Lispro (Treatment B): 100 U/mL insulin lispro, injected SC, pre-meals, doses titrated to each participant individually.
Throughout the study, participants requiring basal insulin used twice daily SC injections of 100 U/mL insulin glargine or maintained their usual regimen through an insulin pump.</description>

            <description>The number of participants with at least one hypoglycemic event (HE) reported during the entire study is presented. Additionally, the number of participants with severe HEs (those that necessitated administration of carbohydrate or glucagon, or resuscitation, by another person) is also presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>
