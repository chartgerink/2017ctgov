      This study evaluated whether lithium included as part of optimized medication treatment
      improved overall level of illness, symptoms of mania and depression, and quality of life in
      people with bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar illness, a brain disorder that causes dramatic changes in a person's mood and
      energy, affects about 2.6% of adults in the United States. Bipolar disorder is characterized
      by cyclical periods of extreme highs and lows, known as episodes of mania and depression. A
      person undergoing an episode of mania often experiences euphoric moods, increased energy,
      and aggressive behaviors, while a person in a depressed state often experiences low moods,
      lack of energy, and feelings of sadness. Lithium is a widely used mood stabilizing
      medication that has been shown to reduce the occurrence and intensity of manic episodes and
      may lessen depressive episodes as well. Including lithium as a part of a personalized
      medication treatment approach may be the most effective means of improving symptoms of
      bipolar disorder. This study will evaluate whether lithium included as part of optimized
      medication treatment improves overall level of illness, symptoms of mania and depression,
      and quality of life in people with bipolar disorder.

      Participation in this study lasted for 6 months. All participants had an initial assessment
      that included an interview and questionnaires to confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
      vital sign measurements, a blood draw, and if female, pregnancy. Eligible participants were
      then assigned randomly to receive either optimized medication plus lithium or optimized
      medication without lithium. Participants in both groups received 6 months of monitored
      treatment with their medication regimens, as prescribed by their study doctor. Participants
      attended study visits every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks and then once a month for 4 more
      months. These visits lasted between 45 and 60 minutes and included medication adjustments
      and questions about symptoms, side effects, and quality of life.

        <description>Scale: Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder Severity (CGI-BP-S) Construct: This scale holistically measures severity of a participant’s depression, mania, and overall illness.
Range: 0- not assessed, 1-normal (not at all ill), 2- borderline mentally ill, 3- mildly ill, 4- moderately ill, 5- markedly ill, 6- severely ill, 7- among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

            <description>Participants received lithium plus optimized medication treatment, as needed.
Lithium Carbonate : Lithium was started at 300 mg and then increased to 600 mg after 3 days. Lithium doses were maintained at 600 mg per day for 8 weeks, but may have been adjusted after that time as needed up to a serum level of 1.2 mEq/L.
Optimized Treatment (OPT) : The foundation of OPT was to maintain treatment that will typically include at least one FDA-approved mood stabilizer other than lithium (e.g., divalproex, carbamazepine, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone) and to follow the recommendations summarized in the evidence-based stages of the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithm (TIMA) revised guidelines.</description>
