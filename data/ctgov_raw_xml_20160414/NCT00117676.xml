  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) compared to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for 48 weeks for the treatment of
      HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Subjects will either receive TDF or the approved
      hepatitis B therapy ADV. After 48 weeks all subjects will be switched to open-label TDF.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of TDF versus ADV will be evaluated for histologic improvement, reductions in
      serum hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA), changes in liver enzymes, and the
      generation of antibody to the virus. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events,
      laboratory abnormalities and the development of drug-resistant mutations. After 48 weeks all
      subjects will receive open-label TDF, and the efficacy and safety of TDF will continue to be
      monitored for the remainder of the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</description>

            <title>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48</title>
            <description>Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</description>
