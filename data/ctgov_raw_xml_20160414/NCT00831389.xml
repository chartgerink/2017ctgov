  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the glycemic control during and following aerobic
      exercise using either an open or closed-loop insulin delivery system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized crossover study evaluating the performance
      of a closed-loop insulin delivery system using a subcutaneous glucose sensor and an external
      insulin pump and comparing it to an open-loop delivery system during aerobic exercise.
      Subject participation will be for a maximum of 16 weeks including an outpatient study (up to
      6 days) and two inpatient studies (one closed-loop; the other open-loop). The closed- and
      open-loop visit consists of approximately 67 hours over 4 days and 3 nights.

          <description>All participants were treated and observed during in-patient visits twice during the study - two (2) in-patient study phases per subject. Each such in-patient phase was conducted for four (4) days. Insulin delivery during the first in-patient study phase was determined by either Standard of Care (OL), or autonomously by a glycemic control algorithm (CL), depending upon randomization. The exercise challenge was conducted on either the second or third day of this visit, depending upon randomization. Insulin delivery during the second in-patient study phase was the delivery mechanism not used during the 1st in-patient visit. The second in-patient study phase exercise challenge was conducted on the day not chosen for exercise during the first in-patient visit. Intervention was performed only when dictated by protocol or determined necessary by the Health Care Professionals monitoring the study.</description>
