    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, single treatment clinical trial evaluates the clinical
      outcomes associated with non-invasive treatment to obtain lift and tightening of facial
      tissue and improve jawline definition in subjects with darker skin color utilizing the
      Ulthera® System to deliver focused ultrasound energy below the skin surface.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      Ulthera® System for the non-invasive treatment to obtain overall lift and tightening of
      facial tissue and jawline definition improvement.

      <recruitment_details>Subjects desiring lift/tightening of cheek tissue, or improved jawline definition and/or submental skin laxity, and were Fitzpatrick skin types 3-6 were recruited. Fifty-four subjects were enrolled at two facilities. Study recruitment initiated 2/16/11; follow-up concluded 1/18/12.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Fifty-four subjects who met study eligibility requirements were assigned a study subject ID. Two subjects withdrew from the study due prior to study treatment. Data from these subjects are not included in the demographic summaries or in the efficacy analyses. Fifty-two subjects received study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
