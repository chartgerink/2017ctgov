    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted-mean 24-hour Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean is calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes (min) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, respectively, at Week 12. The Baseline value was the Day 1 pre-dose FEV1 measurement. Change from Baseline is calculated as the weighted mean 0-24 hour FEV1 (Liters) at Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The time span during which the participants did not have to take any rescue bronchodilator (medication intended to relieve symptoms immediately) was considered to be a rescue-free period. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant (including the day of randomization). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Weeks 1-12 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants who were symptom free for 24-hour periods during the12-week treatment period were assessed. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant (including the day of randomization). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Weeks 1-12 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The individual serial FEV1 is calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes (min) and 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, relatively, on Treatment Day 84 (Week 12). The Baseline value was the Day 1 pre-dose FEV1 measurement. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the individual serial FEV1 taken at Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. Analysis was performed separately for each planned time point.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Trough (Pre-dose and Pre-rescue Bronchodilator) PM (Evening) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Trough PEF is the PEF measured approximately 24 hours after the last administration of study drug. The Baseline value is the average value of the last 7 days of daily PM PEF prior to randomization. Change from Baseline in trough PM PEF was calculated as the averaged value of all daily PM PEF for Week 1 to Week 12 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The number of participants with a &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL increase from Baseline in FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) was evaluated on Day 1 and Week 12 for the time to a &gt;=12% increase from Baseline (at the 5 minutes (min), 15 min, 30 min, 1hour (hr), and 2 hr nominal time points. Participants who did not achieve a &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL increase from Baseline in FEV1 over this time period were considered censored.</description>

    <description>At the end of Week 4 and Week 12, the Global Assessment of Change Questionnaire, which assesses changes in asthma symptoms and rescue medication use, was completed by participants using the following scale: asthma symptom (AS) change: much better, somewhat better, a little better, the same, a little worse, somewhat worse, much worse; rescue medication use (RMU): much less often , somewhat less often , a little less often , the same , a little more often , somewhat more often , much more often.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>347 participants (par.) were randomized to treatment; all 347 were included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population. One par. was not randomized but received treatment in error. This par. was not included in the ITT Population and is thus not captured in the Participant Flow module. This par. is categorized as being enrolled in the study (n=348).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants (par.) meeting eligibility criteria at the Screening visit completed a 28-day Run-in Period for Baseline, safety evaluations, and measures of asthma status. Par. were then randomized to an 8-week Treatment Period. A total of 583 par. were screened, and 347 were randomized, of which 298 received at least one dose of study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted-mean 24-hour Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean is calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes (min) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, respectively, at Week 12. The Baseline value was the Day 1 pre-dose FEV1 measurement. Change from Baseline is calculated as the weighted mean 0-24 hour FEV1 (Liters) at Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <description>The time span during which the participants did not have to take any rescue bronchodilator (medication intended to relieve symptoms immediately) was considered to be a rescue-free period. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant (including the day of randomization). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Weeks 1-12 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Serial FEV1 Assessments at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period, Including the 12-hour and 24-hour Time Points</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The individual serial FEV1 is calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes (min) and 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, relatively, on Treatment Day 84 (Week 12). The Baseline value was the Day 1 pre-dose FEV1 measurement. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the individual serial FEV1 taken at Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. Analysis was performed separately for each planned time point.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Trough (Pre-dose and Pre-rescue Bronchodilator) PM (Evening) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Trough PEF is the PEF measured approximately 24 hours after the last administration of study drug. The Baseline value is the average value of the last 7 days of daily PM PEF prior to randomization. Change from Baseline in trough PM PEF was calculated as the averaged value of all daily PM PEF for Week 1 to Week 12 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>
