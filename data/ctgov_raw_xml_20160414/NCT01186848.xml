  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused
      ultrasound when used in conjunction with 1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser versus
      1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser alone for treatment of striae distensae(stretch
      marks).

      Each side of thigh (or abdomen) was randomized to receive 1550nm-fractionated laser
      treatment every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments on one side and the contralateral side
      received micro-focused ultrasound treatment and 1550nm-fractionated laser alternatively
      every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments with site-match control area of baseline striae on
      each side.

      The primary outcome measure by two dermatologists blindly compared the two areas of striae
      distensae on each side from live subjects using a questionnaire and quartile rating scale on
      the final follow-up visit.

      This study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary outcomes were qualitative measurements of the mean striae width in the
      treatment area before(week0) and after treatment(week10) and subject satisfaction was
      determined by a satisfaction questionnaire.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (Fractional Laser vs. Fractional Laser plus Intense Focused Ultrasound) with the best cosmetic appearance. Two dermatologists blindly evaluated the treated and control areas of each side from live subjects on the final follow up visit (week 10). This was reported as percentages of participants for whom &quot;1550-nm Erbium-doped Fractionated Laser&quot; or &quot;Micro-focused Ultrasound and 1550nm-fractionated Laser&quot; resulted in the &quot;best cosmetic appearance&quot;.</description>
