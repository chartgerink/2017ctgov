    <description>The ASAS20 is defined as an improvement of at least 20 % and absolute improvement of at least 1 unit on a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 following domains:
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity
Pain assessment (total spinal pain)

    <description>The BASFI assesses physical function in comprising 10 items relating to activities during the past week. Each item ranges from 0 (&quot;Easy&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Impossible&quot;). The BASFI is the mean of the 10 scores such that the total score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating better physical function. A negative value in BASFI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numerical Rating Scales (NRSs) to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration, respectively) over the last week. The final BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity. A negative value in BASDAI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BASMI characterizes the spinal mobility of subjects with axial Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Spine Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scoring System for Disease Activity (ASspiMRI-a) in the Berlin Modification at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Berlin modification of the ASspiMRI-a is a scoring system with a concentration on Short-Tau-Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences without other fat saturation techniques. It quantifies changes in 23 Vertebral Units (VU) of the spine. A VU is defined as the region between 2 virtual lines through the middle of each vertebra. Active inflammation is scored by grading the degree of bone marrow edema from 0 to 3 in 1 dimension on 1 or more consecutive slices that represent the highest level of inflammation in a particular VU. Total spine ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modification can range from 0 to 69 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. A negative value in total spine ASspiMRI-a score change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the higher the reduction of inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sacroiliac Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SPARCC scoring method for lesions found on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on an abnormal increased signal on the Short-Tau-Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence, representing bone marrow edema. Total Sacroiliac (SI) joint SPARCC score can range from 0 to 72 with higher scores indicating higher joint inflammation. A negative value in SPARCC change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the higher the reduction of inflammation.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is a multicenter study with 128 sites in North America, Latin America, Western Europe, and Central/Eastern Europe.
325 subjects are included in Randomized Set (RS) shown in Participant Flow, which is an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) dataset. At Week 16, 56 placebo-escape subjects were re-randomized to one CZP arm.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients with positive Tuberculosis (Tb) tests within Screening Period, but no signs and symptoms of active Tb had to be treated with prophylactic Tb treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration.
Data provided here are Interim Results for the 24-weeks double-blind, placebo-controlled Period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The BASFI assesses physical function in comprising 10 items relating to activities during the past week. Each item ranges from 0 (“Easy”) to 10 (“Impossible”). The BASFI is the mean of the 10 scores such that the total score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating better physical function. A negative value in BASFI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

        <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numerical Rating Scales (NRSs) to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration, respectively) over the last week. The final BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity. A negative value in BASDAI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The BASMI characterizes the spinal mobility of subjects with axial Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient’s limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient’s limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Spine Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scoring System for Disease Activity (ASspiMRI-a) in the Berlin Modification at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Berlin modification of the ASspiMRI-a is a scoring system with a concentration on Short-Tau-Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences without other fat saturation techniques. It quantifies changes in 23 Vertebral Units (VU) of the spine. A VU is defined as the region between 2 virtual lines through the middle of each vertebra. Active inflammation is scored by grading the degree of bone marrow edema from 0 to 3 in 1 dimension on 1 or more consecutive slices that represent the highest level of inflammation in a particular VU. Total spine ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modification can range from 0 to 69 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. A negative value in total spine ASspiMRI-a score change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the higher the reduction of inflammation.</description>
