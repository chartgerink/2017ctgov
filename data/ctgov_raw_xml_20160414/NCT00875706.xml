      Background:

      The study explored the feasibility of an educational intervention to strengthen
      workplace-learning systems in four VA Community Living Centers (CLCs).

      Objectives:

      Specific aims were to 1) conduct a feasibility study to assess whether the educational
      intervention is practical to implement as designed and 2) conduct a pilot study to validate
      the methodology proposed for assessing outcomes of this educational intervention.

      Methods:

      A multi-level intervention targeting the translation of workplace learning into practice was
      implemented. The Direct Care Worker (DCW) intervention targeted both clinical knowledge and
      effective communication. The Coaching Supervision training addressed management and
      supervision practices for nurses, combined with effective communication. Four CLCs received
      both interventions, administered by the Paraprofessional Health Institute (PHI), using a
      train-the-trainer approach over the course of four 3-day sessions. Quantitative and
      qualitative data were collected to assess factors influencing effectiveness of
      implementation and to understand the impact of the trainings on participants.

      Status:

      The study has been completed with educational interventions implemented and qualitative and
      quantitative data collected.

    <description>The intervention consists of two (2) different types of training, both to be delivered through a train-the-trainer approach. The first of these is coaching-supervision training for nurse managers and other supervisory personnel in the CLC units. The second component is a one-day training for DCWs on communication and managing problem behaviors associated with dementia. These two trainings build on validated training models that have been developed by PHINational, but will be adapted and customized to include VA-developed clinical content on the management of problem behaviors associated with dementia.</description>

          <description>Survey data collection tools were piloted to assess feasibility of survey administration and development for use in a long-term care setting. These tools were piloted in sites where the educational intervention was administered.
The survey was a modified version of the Care Coordination Survey which was originally validated in a hospital setting (citation below). The survey pertains to work context factors that shape practice, including staffing and resources, communication and IT, participation in decision-making, relationships with supervisors, professional empowerment, and relational coordination. Modifications were made for use of the survey in a VA Community Living Centers.
