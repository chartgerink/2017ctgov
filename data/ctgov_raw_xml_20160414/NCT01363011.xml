  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the effect of cobicistat-based regimens on parameters of renal
      function in subjects with HIV infection and who have mild to moderate renal impairment, and
      to assess the safety and tolerability of the regimens in order to generate appropriate
      dosing recommendations.
