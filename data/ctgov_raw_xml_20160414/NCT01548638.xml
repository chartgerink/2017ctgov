  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary open-label study to determine whether a medication called galantamine
      (Brand Name: Razadyne) will help smokers quit and whether it reduces cognitive problems that
      smokers experience during a quit attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galantamine, an FDA-approved treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is used to treat cognitive
      impairment by enhancing acetylcholine through inhibition of the enzyme,
      acetylcholinesterase. We propose an open-label pilot feasibility study of short-term (6
      weeks) treatment with galantamine.

      Sixteen chronic smokers will undergo a validated procedure for screening new medications.
      Following an initial 4-week drug run-up phase (8mg daily of galantamine-ER), medication dose
      will be increased to 16 mg daily of galantamine-ER during the fifth and sixth weeks of the
      study. At the beginning of Week 6, smokers will receive brief counseling and make a 7-day
      quit attempt.

      Following completion of the study, participants will be offered standard smoking cessation
      treatment. Subjects will perform a working memory task (Visual/Spatial N-Back), a sustained
      attention task (Continuous Performance Task; CPT), a recall memory task (Word Recognition),
      a cognitive flexibility task (Wisconsin Card Sort Test), and a response inhibition task
      (Stop Signal Task). The primary outcome is the ability to remain abstinent during a 7-day
      quit attempt. Secondary outcomes include change in cognitive performance, adherence, and
      side effects.

      This pilot study will provide information about the role of the cholinergic system during
      brief abstinence and whether enhancing acetylcholine reduces abstinence-induced cognitive
      symptoms that promote smoking relapse. Information obtained in this study may further
      establish cognitive performance measures as endophenotypes for nicotine dependence.

    <description>Participants will complete neurocognitive test designed to test working memory and attention and are similar to computer games, in that participants will push a button in response to the pictures they see. Working memory was measured using a computerized N-back task. During the N-back, participants are instructed to remember the location of a stimulus, a grey circle that is approximately 5 cm in diameter, as it appears randomly in 8 possible locations around the perimeter of a computer screen. Stimulus duration is 200 ms, followed by an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2800 ms. The N-back task includes 4 conditions of varying difficulty levels: the 0-back, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back.
Median reaction time to correct responses is described below.
Typical responses range from 250 ms to 1500 ms.</description>

A 37-item checklist of side effects based on the product insert (e.g., Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Loss of appetite, Stomach pain, Constipation, Gastroesophageal Reflux Problems (Heartburn)) was administered to participants at all study visits after the Intake. An open-ended side effects question was also be included.
Items were measured on a scale from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe).
The side effect summary score (total side effects averaged from the 37 item checklist) at each visit is reported below. Each score ranges from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe).</description>

Galantamine ER : The study will be performed using the 8mg and 16mg doses of galantamine hydrobromide-ER, which is currently marketed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The dosing regimen, which follows FDA-approved guidelines, will be an initial 4 weeks of drug run-up at the lowest 8mg daily dose, followed by an additional one week of drug run-up at the higher dose of 16mg daily.
Participants will continue to take the 16mg daily during the 7-day quit week, for a total of 6 weeks of treatment with galantamine-ER.</description>

Galantamine ER : The study will be performed using the 8mg and 16mg doses of galantamine hydrobromide-ER, which is currently marketed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The dosing regimen, which follows FDA-approved guidelines, will be an initial 4 weeks of drug run-up at the lowest 8mg daily dose, followed by an additional one week of drug run-up at the higher dose of 16mg daily.
Participants will continue to take the 16mg daily during the 7-day quit week, for a total of 6 weeks of treatment with galantamine-ER.</description>

        <description>Participants will complete neurocognitive test designed to test working memory and attention and are similar to computer games, in that participants will push a button in response to the pictures they see. Working memory was measured using a computerized N-back task. During the N-back, participants are instructed to remember the location of a stimulus, a grey circle that is approximately 5 cm in diameter, as it appears randomly in 8 possible locations around the perimeter of a computer screen. Stimulus duration is 200 ms, followed by an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2800 ms. The N-back task includes 4 conditions of varying difficulty levels: the 0-back, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back.
Median reaction time to correct responses is described below.
Typical responses range from 250 ms to 1500 ms.</description>

Items were measured on a scale from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe).
The side effect summary score (total side effects averaged from the 37 item checklist) at each visit is reported below. Each score ranges from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe).</description>

Galantamine ER : The study will be performed using the 8mg and 16mg doses of galantamine hydrobromide-ER, which is currently marketed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The dosing regimen, which follows FDA-approved guidelines, will be an initial 4 weeks of drug run-up at the lowest 8mg daily dose, followed by an additional one week of drug run-up at the higher dose of 16mg daily.
Participants will continue to take the 16mg daily during the 7-day quit week, for a total of 6 weeks of treatment with galantamine-ER.</description>
