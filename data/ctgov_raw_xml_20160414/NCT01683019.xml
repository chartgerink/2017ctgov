  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study investigates effects of EEG-based low frequency, low emission
      magnetic cortical stimulation in comparison to a sham treatment in subjects with moderate to
      severe depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with functional impairment and disability, and
      results in a significant burden on the affected individual, his or her family, and society
      in general. Psychopharmacological therapy has been shown to be effective, but may be
      accompanied by significant side effects. The investigators propose an alternative model,
      based on the relationship between symptoms, brain metabolism, and neural activity as
      recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects with MDD often have decreased brain
      metabolism, accompanied by increased EEG activity in the alpha band. The investigators
      hypothesis is that a gentle, non-significant risk, sinusoidal magnetic field above the
      subject's scalp, which oscillates at precisely his or her Intrinsic Alpha Frequency (IAF)
      can take advantage of this relationship to reduce symptoms without the significant side
      effects associated with pharmaceuticals. The investigators propose a 4-week, sham
      controlled, randomized, double-blind multi-center feasibility study to determine the
      efficacy of synchronized low energy magnetic fields delivered at the subject's IAF to treat
      MDD. Treatment will be given concomitant to the subject's existing medication, and will
      occur 5 days per week at the clinical site. Target enrollment is 45 adult subjects diagnosed
      with MDD.

    <description>Outcome measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and calculated as percent change in severity score from baseline until the end of the 4th week of treatment.
The HAMD-17 scale ranges between 0-54, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>

            <title>Percent Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) at Baseline and the End of Week 4 of Treatment.</title>
            <description>Outcome measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and calculated as percent change in severity score from baseline until the end of the 4th week of treatment.
The HAMD-17 scale ranges between 0-54, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>
