    <textblock>
      An investigational multi-purpose solution (MPS)was clinically evaluated against Biotrue MPS
      at specific time points over the course of four days. The study was conducted with
      PureVision lenses.

    <description>All participants were contact lenses wearers and were evaluated with a Corneal Staining at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and end of day. The corneal staining test is performed using fluorescein drops in the eye and ultraviolet illumination to determine if there has been any damage to the cornea from the use of the lens solutions or from the use of the contact lens.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  were at least 18 years old;

          -  were experienced contact lens wearers;

          -  were correctable to at least 20/40 or better in both eyes with contact lenses;

          -  were in good general health, with healthy eyes (other than requiring vision
             correction);

          -  had not worn lenses for at least 12 hours before each baseline visit;

          -  had a corneal staining score no greater than Grade 1 in either eye at time of
             enrollment;

          -  had previously used an MPS or hydrogen peroxide solution successfully.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  had a confirmed diagnosis of Sj√∂gren's syndrome or other condition that results in a
             chronic and/or pathologic dry eye condition;

          -  required concurrent ocular medication or have used ocular medication within 24 hours
             of entering the study;

          -  had a known sensitivity or intolerance to any MPS, study products or ingredient(s);

          -  were currently participating in any other clinical study;

          -  had a condition or are in a situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put
             them at significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with
             their participation in the study.
