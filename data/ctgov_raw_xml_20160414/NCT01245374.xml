    <description>Analysed for the ITT (intent-to-treat) analysis set: The relative ease of use of the trial injection device compared to the device previously used was assessed using a quantitative scale, ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 = NordiFlex® is far less simple, 5 = equivalent simplicity and 10 = NordiFlex® is far more simple. The participants had to circle the number that represented their perception of the current state.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants had to receive training for the use of Nordiflex® system. A member of the investigator's team, physician or nurse, was in charge of this training. At inclusion and before receiving treatment, participants or parents had to complete a questionnaire about the ease of use of the previously used device.</pre_assignment_details>
