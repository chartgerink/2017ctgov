  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the addition of Cognitive Therapy (CT) to antidepressant
      medication (ADM) enhances treatment for depression. This study will also test whether the
      addition of CT to ADM will prevent recurrences of depression after therapy is over.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly believed that the combination of ADM and psychotherapy is more effective in
      treating depression than either treatment alone. Data indicate that CT enhances the initial
      effects of ADM, but little research has been conducted to determine whether prior exposure
      to CT prevents the onset of new depressive episodes. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of adding CT to ADM for the treatment of depression.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either ADM alone or ADM plus CT for up to 18
      months. Remitted patients are continued on medication for up to 36 months from the point of
      initial randomization until they meet criteria for recovery. At recovery, patients receiving
      combined treatment discontinue cognitive therapy; all recovered patients are randomized a
      second time to either maintenance medication or medication withdrawal. Patients are then
      monitored over 36 months to ascertain risk for recurrence of depressive symptoms.

Cognitive Therapy (CT): CT sessions occur weekly during acute treatment and monthly during continuation. Acute treatment may last up to 18 months. Remitted patients are continued on medication for up to 36 months from initial randomization until they meet criteria for recovery. At recovery, patients receiving combined treatment discontinue CT.
Antidepressant medications: Antidepressant medication is distributed as clinically indicated with augmentation and ancillary medications as needed. Acute treatment may last up to 18 months. Remitted patients are continued on medication for up to 36 months from the point of initial randomization until they meet criteria for recovery. All recovered patients are randomized a second time to either maintenance medication or medication withdrawal. Patients are then monitored over 36 months to ascertain risk for recurrence of depressive symptoms.</description>
