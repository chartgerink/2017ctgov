  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase 4, multi-center, open-label study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of DUEXIS in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients aged 10
      years to 16 years, 11 months, treated up to 24 weeks.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the PK characteristics of DUEXIS in JIA patients
      and to evaluate the signs and symptoms of JIA in patients aged 10 years to 16 years, 11
      months receiving DUEXIS for up to 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 JIA patients who meet all eligibility criteria and who are expected to
      require daily administration of an NSAID for up to 24 weeks will be enrolled. A subset of
      approximately 6 patients will participate in a single dose PK study at Day 0 with an
      abbreviated PK profile performed at Week 4 if possible. Multiple dose PK sampling will occur
      in all enrolled patients.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess patient quality of life while on study medication, the CHQ was administered to the patients' parent or guardian on Day 0 and at the Week 24/ET visit. The raw scale scores were transformed into scores on a 0 to 100 scale, 100 indicating best health and 0 indicating worst health. The algorithm is:
Transformed Score = ((Actual Raw Score - Lowest Possible Raw Score)/(Possible Raw Score Range)) x100. The actual raw score is the mean of the item responses in a scale (sum of item responses/number of completed items). The possible raw score range is the highest possible raw score minus the lowest possible raw score. The outcome measure data table shows the average change in the CHQ concepts from Baseline to the week 24 visit. The average change in the CHQ concepts is on a -100 to 100 scale, -100 representing a negative change in health and 100 indicating a positive change in health.</description>

        <title>Childhood Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50) Scores</title>
        <description>To assess patient quality of life while on study medication, the CHQ was administered to the patients' parent or guardian on Day 0 and at the Week 24/ET visit. The raw scale scores were transformed into scores on a 0 to 100 scale, 100 indicating best health and 0 indicating worst health. The algorithm is:
Transformed Score = ((Actual Raw Score - Lowest Possible Raw Score)/(Possible Raw Score Range)) x100. The actual raw score is the mean of the item responses in a scale (sum of item responses/number of completed items). The possible raw score range is the highest possible raw score minus the lowest possible raw score. The outcome measure data table shows the average change in the CHQ concepts from Baseline to the week 24 visit. The average change in the CHQ concepts is on a -100 to 100 scale, -100 representing a negative change in health and 100 indicating a positive change in health.</description>

            <title>Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of DUEXIS in JIA Patients: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From the Time of Dosing to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC(0-t))</title>
            <description>AUC(0-t) was estimated for ibuprofen and famotidine. The PK parameters for ibuprofen and famotidine represent average AUC values following a single oral dose of DUEXIS. Samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 to 10 hours following study drug administration.</description>
