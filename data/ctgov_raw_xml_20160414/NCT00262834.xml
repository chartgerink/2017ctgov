      This phase II trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating women who are
      undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.
      Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving vorinostat before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be
      removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in women undergoing surgery for newly
      diagnosed stage I-III breast cancer.

      OULINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days -3 to 0. Approximately 2 hours after
      the final dose of vorinostat, patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

    <description>Participants were evaluated for adverse events due to vorinostat to assess if it was safe to give the drug prior to surgery. 17 of 25 participants who received vorinostat experienced at least 1 adverse event believed to be related to the study drug; no adverse events were severe, and the treatment was considered safe.</description>

    <description>Change in Ki-67 (a marker of tissue proliferation) by IHC compared to baseline in the treated (22 evaluable samples) or untreated patients (15 evaluable samples) were analyzed between groups. Ki-67 is a protein in cells that increases as cellsprepare to divide into new cells. A staining process can measure the percentage of tumor cells that are positive for Ki-67. The more positive cells there are, the more quickly they are dividing and forming new cells.</description>

        <title>Change in Tissue Proliferation After 3 Days of Treatment</title>
        <description>Change in Ki-67 (a marker of tissue proliferation) by IHC compared to baseline in the treated (22 evaluable samples) or untreated patients (15 evaluable samples) were analyzed between groups. Ki-67 is a protein in cells that increases as cellsprepare to divide into new cells. A staining process can measure the percentage of tumor cells that are positive for Ki-67. The more positive cells there are, the more quickly they are dividing and forming new cells.</description>
