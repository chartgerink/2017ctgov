  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pedicled transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM) flaps are the most common
      post-mastectomy breast reconstructive surgeries that utilize the patient's tissue. The
      pedicled TRAM flap involves harvesting skin, fat, and muscle from the abdomen to create a
      new breast. TRAM flap complications include fat necrosis of the reconstructed breast,
      delayed wound healing, and abdominal bulge or hernia. Pain at the abdominal donor site is a
      major contributor to the need for four to five days of post-operative hospital stay. Pulsed
      electromagnetic field (PEMF) technologies have been useful as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of delayed union fractures, chronic wounds and post-operative pain. PEMF devices
      are economical and disposable, and can be incorporated unobtrusively in standard
      post-operative dressings. The investigators have recently reported, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study on breast reduction, that post-op PEMF therapy produced a
      significant decrease in pain and pain medication use, along with a concomitant decrease in
      IL1-beta in the wound bed.

      The proposed study seeks to determine whether similar results will be obtained after a
      significantly more extensive surgical procedure, like the TRAM flap. Patients scheduled for
      pedicled TRAM flap breast reconstruction of a single breast immediately following mastectomy
      will be enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Subjects will
      be assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group with active PEMF devices and a placebo
      group with sham devices that deliver no PEMF. PEMF and sham devices will be taped over both
      the breast reconstruction and abdominal donor sites. Patients will keep the devices in place
      for their hospital stay and for a total of two weeks. The investigators hypothesize that
      subjects in the PEMF treatment group compared to placebo will have a faster reduction in
      pain, take less pain and nausea medications, have lower levels of IL1-beta in wound exudate,
      have a shorter hospital stay, and have less wound-healing complications.

      Operations will be performed by one of two plastic surgeons who perform this surgery in a
      similar manner. The entire unilateral rectus abdominis muscle will be harvested with
      fascial-sparing as part of the pedicled TRAM flap. The flap will be shaped and sutured to
      the chest site, and the abdominal fascial defect will be closed primarily, followed by a
      polypropylene mesh overlay. Two 10 mm Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains will be placed in the flap
      wound, and two JPs will be placed in the abdominal wound. Immediately after transfer of the
      extubated patient to the recovery room bed, study devices will be placed on the
      reconstructed breast and abdominal donor sites, and activated. In the treatment arm, the
      PEMF signal is automatically delivered every two hours for fifteen minutes while the patient
      is in the hospital.

IL1-beta is an early central proinflammatory cytokine that induces cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. A decrease in IL1-beta correlates with a decrease in pain. Cytokines and growth factors may contribute to more rapid post-op pain reduction and healing.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who decide to have immediate unilateral TRAM flap breast reconstruction
             and are deemed candidates for this surgery. Patients who have undergone or will be
             undergoing sentinel lymph node or axillary lymph node dissection will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not candidates for TRAM flap reconstruction will be excluded.
             Specific reasons for a patient not to be a candidate will be determined by the
             surgeon, but may include patients who have minimal abdominal tissue, patients with
             multiple medical co-morbidities, patients who have had prior abdominal surgeries that
             preclude a pedicled operation, or patients who are morbidly obese.

          -  Additionally, patients who opt for a free TRAM flap or DIEP flap will be excluded
             since their abdominal donor site morbidity is different than a pedicled TRAM flap.

          -  Patients undergoing bilateral reconstruction will also be excluded, because of the
             more extensive nature of the surgery and donor-site morbidity, which might confound
             results.

            <title>Change in Pain Level Between 1 Hours Post-op and 12 Hours Post-op</title>
            <description>We will record postoperative pain, as reported by the patient and quantified by a standardized visual analog scale (VAS), with written descriptions at 12 hours post-op and assess that pain level in comparison with previous timepoint pain levels, such as 1 hour post-op. The VAS pain scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

        <title>Levels of Cytokines</title>
        <description>Concentration of the cytokines IL1-beta in the wound bed. Exudates will be collected from standard Jackson-Pratt #10 drains until the patient is discharged. IL1-beta is an early central proinflammatory cytokine that induces cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. A decrease in IL1-beta correlates with a decrease in pain. Cytokines and growth factors may contribute to more rapid post-op pain reduction and healing.</description>
