  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to obtain data about the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of
      indacaterol (150, 300, and 600 µg) in Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) so that optimal dose(s) could be chosen for testing in later studies.

    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made in each treatment period at 22, 23, and 24 hours post-dose on Day 2. Standardized FEV1 AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal rule. The analysis included patient, period, and treatment group as fixed effects and baseline FEV1 prior to drug administration in the treatment period as a covariate.</description>

            <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made in each treatment period at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours on Day 1 and 22, 23, and 24 hours on Day 2. The analysis included baseline FEV1 prior to drug administration in the treatment period as a covariate.</description>
