      Specific Aim 1. To determine the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      isolated monocytes and target tissues in IMIDs.

      Specific Aim 2. To analyze the change in gene expression profiles in patients with Crohn's
      disease, psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis before and after infliximab therapy.

      Our hypothesis is that hematopoietic stem cells are very sensitive to elevated levels of
      TNFa, which potentiates their differentiation into myeloid effector cells. During their
      migration from the bone marrow to the end organ, these cells express a unique set of genes
      that function to prime these cells to respond to critical differentiation signals.
      Elucidation of this transcriptome through microarray analysis will provide insight into
      novel drug targets and a formal understanding of the biochemical and molecular genetic
      events linking IMIDs. To test our hypothesis, will determine the transcriptome in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells and isolated monocytes from 20 normal healthy donors, 10 patients
      with psoriatic arthritis, 10 patients with psoriasis, 10 patients with Crohn's disease and
      10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The transcriptome will also be examined in inflamed
      intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease, psoriatic skin and synovial tissue
      from patients with rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.

    <description>The DAS28 for RA and PsA subjects is an outcome measure used in determining the severity of an individual's disease. This score is used to assess disease activity and to make and monitor treatment decisions. The baseline DAS28 is an average of the study populations baseline disease activity score prior to the administration of Infliximab (remicade). A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A subject is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6.</description>

    <description>The DAS28 for RA and PsA subjects is an outcome measure used in determining the severity of an individual's disease. This score is used to assess disease activity and to make and monitor treatment decisions. The week 10 DAS28 is an average of the study population's week 10 disease activity score after taking infliximab (remicade) for 10 weeks. A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity.

    <description>The DAS28 Delta for RA and PsA subjects is measure used to determine the change in the severity of an individual's disease with positive delta indicating an improvement in the severity of subject's disease and a negative delta indicating a worsening of a subject's disease. The delta score is used to monitor treatment. The week 10 DAS28 Delta is determined by calculating the average change between the wk 0 and wk 10 DAS28.</description>

    <description>A PASI score for Ps subjects is an outcome measure used in determining the severity of an individual's disease. This score is used to assess disease activity and to make and monitor treatment decisions. The baseline PASI is an average of the study populations baseline disease activity score prior to the administration of infliximab (remicade). While higher PASI scores indicate more severe psoriasis, it is difficult for subjects or doctors to describe the clinical severity for any specific PASI number.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 for RA and PsA subjects is an outcome measure used in determining the severity of an individual's disease. This score is used to assess disease activity and to make and monitor treatment decisions. The baseline DAS28 is an average of the study populations baseline disease activity score prior to the administration of Infliximab (remicade). A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A subject is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6.</description>
