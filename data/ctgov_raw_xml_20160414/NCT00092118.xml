    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an approved medication on the
      symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose
      similar to that found in hay fever except that symptoms persist throughout the year), in
      patients who have a history of perennial allergic rhinitis.

    <description>Patients completed the validated, self-administered RQLQ which included 28 items on a 7-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, nonnose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The scores for each domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged to obtain the overall score.</description>
