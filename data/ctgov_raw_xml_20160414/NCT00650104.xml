      The purpose of this study is to obtain information on the long-term safety, tolerability,
      and therapeutic benefit of extended release ropinirole XL, and to provide a mechanism for
      patients who participated in either Study 167 or Study 164 to continue receiving ropinirole
      XL if they chose to do so.

    <description>The UPDRS is a clinician-based scale used to assess the longitudinal course of PD. Two of the six sections were assessed (Part II, Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Part III, Motor Examination). Both consist of a number of items (ADL, 13 items; Motor Exam., 17 items), and each item has a choice of 5 responses that are numerically scored 0-4, with 0 as the least severe response and 4 as the most severe response. ADL final score is a sum of the 13 items and may have a value between 0 (no impairment of overall activities) and 52 (severe impairment of overall activities).

    <description>AEs, defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, were collected to obtain data on the safety, tolerability, and benefit of ropinirole XL. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), defined as AEs that are either fatal, life threatening, disabling/incapacitating, resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of a hospital stay, a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or any important medical occurrence that the investigator regards as serious based on medical judgment, were also collected. st. med., study medication.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Study 101468/196 (this study; NCT#00650104) was an open-label, ropinirole XL (2-24 mg/day), continuation study for participants with Parkinson's Disease who previously completed Studies 167 or 164. Treatment was originally designed to continue for 3 years, but it was extended until ropinirole XL became commercially available in each study country.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Ropinirole XL</title>
          <description>Up-titration: some participants from Study 167 started at 2 milligrams (mg) ropinirole XL once daily. Then, depending on the response/tolerance of each participant, the dose was increased in 1 mg weekly increments to 4 mg, then 2 mg weekly increments up to 12 mg, and in either 2 mg or 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg to the clinical optimum dose. Other Study 167 participants were increased in 2 mg weekly increments up to 8 mg and then 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg. Study 164 particiapnts who were on an optimal dose of ropinirole XL could go straight into the long-term treatment period, and those who were receiving ropinirole IR could be switched to the corresponding XL dose. Long-term treatment: participants received study medication until market availability of ropinirole XL. After market availability, participants would undergo a 1-week down-titration period; after protocol amendment #4 approval, participants could switch directly to the market-available dose.</description>

          <description>Up-titration: some participants from Study 167 started at 2 milligrams (mg) ropinirole XL once daily. Then, depending on the response/tolerance of each participant, the dose was increased in 1 mg weekly increments to 4 mg, then 2 mg weekly increments up to 12 mg, and in either 2 mg or 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg to the clinical optimum dose. Other Study 167 participants were increased in 2 mg weekly increments up to 8 mg and then 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg. Study 164 particiapnts who were on an optimal dose of ropinirole XL could go straight into the long-term treatment period, and those who were receiving ropinirole IR could be switched to the corresponding XL dose. Long-term treatment: participants received study medication until market availability of ropinirole XL. After market availability, participants would undergo a 1-week down-titration period; after protocol amendment #4 approval, participants could switch directly to the market-available dose.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician-based scale used to assess the longitudinal course of PD. Two of the six sections were assessed (Part II, Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Part III, Motor Examination). Both consist of a number of items (ADL, 13 items; Motor Exam., 17 items), and each item has a choice of 5 responses that are numerically scored 0-4, with 0 as the least severe response and 4 as the most severe response. ADL final score is a sum of the 13 items and may have a value between 0 (no impairment of overall activities) and 52 (severe impairment of overall activities). LTT, long-term treatment.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician-based scale used to assess the longitudinal course of PD. Two of the six sections were assessed (Part II, Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Part III, Motor Examination). Both consist of a number of items (ADL, 13 items; Motor Exam., 17 items), and each item has a choice of 5 responses that are numerically scored 0-4, with 0 as the least severe response and 4 as the most severe response. ADL final score is a sum of the 13 items and may have a value between 0 (no impairment of overall activities) and 52 (severe impairment of overall activities). LTT, long-term treatment.</description>

Then, depending on the response/tolerance of each participant, the dose was increased in 1 mg weekly increments to 4 mg, then 2 mg weekly increments up to 12 mg, and in either 2 mg or 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg to the clinical optimum dose. Other Study 167 participants were increased in 2 mg weekly increments up to 8 mg and then 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg. Study 164 particiapnts who were on an optimal dose of ropinirole XL could go straight into the long-term treatment period, and those who were receiving ropinirole IR could be switched to the corresponding XL dose. Long-term treatment: participants received study medication until market availability of ropinirole XL. After market availability, participants would undergo a 1-week down-titration period; after protocol amendment #4 approval, participants could switch directly to the market-available dose.</description>

            <title>Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Examination Score (Reponder Population)</title>
            <description>Two of the six UPDRS sections (Part II, Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Part III, Motor Examination) were assessed in this study. The Motor Exam has 17 items, some of which are assessed in both the left and right extremities. Each item has a choice of 5 responses that are numerically scored 0-4 (0 as the least severe, 4 as the most severe). The final score is a sum of the 17 items, with some sections requiring multiple grades assigned to each extremity, and has a value ranging from 0 (no motor impairment) to 108 (severe motor impairment).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Responses for CGI Global Impression (CGI-I) (Maintained Responder Population)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale comprises the following three components (CGI-Severity, CGI-Improvement, Index); where only the CGI-S and CGI-I were assessed in this study. CGI-I is a global improvement scale that scores the clinician’s view of the participant’s global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse.</description>

            <description>Up-titration: some participants from Study 167 started at 2 milligrams (mg) ropinirole XL once daily. Then, depending on the response/tolerance of each participant, the dose was increased in 1 mg weekly increments to 4 mg, then 2 mg weekly increments up to 12 mg, and in either 2 mg or 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg to the clinical optimum dose. Other Study 167 participants were increased in 2 mg weekly increments up to 8 mg and then 4 mg weekly increments up to 24 mg. Study 164 particiapnts who were on an optimal dose of ropinirole XL could go straight into the long-term treatment period, and those who were receiving ropinirole IR could be switched to the corresponding XL dose. Long-term treatment: participants received study medication until market availability of ropinirole XL. After market availability, participants would undergo a 1-week down-titration period; after protocol amendment #4 approval, participants could switch directly to the market-available dose.</description>
