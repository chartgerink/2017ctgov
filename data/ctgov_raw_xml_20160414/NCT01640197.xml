  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of chronic resveratrol supplementation have yet to be investigated in healthy
      humans. It is hypothesised that the effects will be different to those seen in acute
      supplementation. This study will look specifically at cognitive performance, cerebral blood
      flow, subjective sleep, mood and health, blood pressure and plasma levels of resveratrol. It
      is hypothesized that these measures will be affected differently by acute and chronic
      supplementation.

    <description>Subjective mood was assessed with the Profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire every 7 days during the 28- day period. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of mood if their scores on week 1, week 2, week 3 and/or week 4 differed significantly from scores on the baseline questionnaire completed on day 1.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cognitive performance was assessed by a range of cognitively demanding tasks on day 28 of the supplementation period. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of cognitive performance if their scores on these tasks were significantly different from scores taken on day 1.</description>

    <description>Subjective perception of sleep quality was assessed with the PSQI. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of sleep if scores on Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and/or Week 4 differed significantly from those on day 1 (baseline).</description>
