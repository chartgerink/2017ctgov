    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this
      trial is to compare the effect on glycaemic control of liraglutide or exenatide when added
      to subject's ongoing OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment of either metformin,
      sulphonylurea or a combination of both in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Two trial periods:
      A 26 week randomised, followed by a 52 week extension (14 + 38 weeks) where all subjects
      received liraglutide + OAD after previous randomisation to either liraglutide or exenatide,
      both combined with OAD treatment.

            <groups_desc>ANCOVA model included treatment, country and previous treatment as fixed effects and baseline value of the endpoint as covariate. The objective was to demonstrate that treatment with liraglutide was different from treatment with exenatide. Thus the null hypothesis and its alternative were H0: µliraglutide = µexenatide against HA1:µliraglutide ≠ µexenatide where µliraglutide and µexenatide is the mean value of the endpoint in the liraglutide arm and exenatide arm, respectively.</groups_desc>
