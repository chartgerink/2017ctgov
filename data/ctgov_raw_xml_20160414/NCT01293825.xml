  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychotropic-related weight gain is a common concern among patients with bipolar disorder
      (BD). This concern affects an individual's satisfaction with treatment and may lead to
      reduced adherence and illness relapse. Patient-focused care is attentive to patient concerns
      while at the same time utilizing evidence-based treatments. Ziprasidone is currently FDA
      approved for the maintenance treatment of BD. Ziprasidone may be associated with less weight
      gain compared to some alternative BD maintenance treatments. The proposed project will
      evaluate how switching to ziprasidone may affect patient adherence, drug attitudes,
      satisfaction with care and clinical outcomes (psychiatric symptoms, functional status,
      weight) among BD patients concerned with weight gain.

    <description>Global psychopathology will be measured with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) (Guy 1976) a widely used scale which evaluates illness severity on a 1 to 7 point continuum. Severity of illness ratings on the CGI have reported reliability scores ranging from 0.41-0.66 (Guy 1976). Lower scores indicate improved outcomes.</description>

    <description>Life and Work Functional status will be evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS), which is derived from the GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning). The GAF is a 100-point single-item scale which measures global functioning of psychiatric patients and is widely utilized in clinical studies involving Seriously Mentally Ill patients (Jones 1995). The reliability of the GAF ranges from 0.62-0.82. Higher scores indicate improved outcomes.</description>

    <description>Patients will identify which psychotropic they currently receive that causes the most weight-gain concern. For individuals on multiple drugs, one drug must be identified as the &quot;offending agent&quot;. Study psychiatrist will switch the &quot;offending agent&quot; to ziprasidone. Participants will be switched to ziprasidone per package insert. Patients will be maintained on ziprasidone for 12 weeks (active part of study). After the active part of the study they will return to the care of their normal clinical provider who will determine whether they will continue on ziprasidone.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Type I or II BD for at least 6 months (confirmed with MINI)

          2. On maintenance evidence-based treatment for BD (lithium, antipsychotic,
             anticonvulsant)

          3. Have weight gain concerns that individual believes are related to BD medication
             treatment

          4. Sub-optimal adherence as measured by the Tablet Routines Questionnaire (TRQ) and
             which the patient feels is related to weight gain concerns. TRQ threshold will be
             defined as missing an average of 20% or more of all prescribed BD treatment in the
             last week or month or missing 20% or more of the &quot;offending agent&quot; in the last week
             or last month. This is consistent with methodologies in PIs previous BD adherence
             studies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known resistance or intolerance to ziprasidone

          2. Medical contraindication to ziprasidone

          3. Individuals on ziprasidone immediately prior to study enrollment

          4. Prior or current treatment with clozapine

          5. Diagnosis of eating disorder

          6. Individuals whose sub-optimal adherence is related to inability to pay for BD
             medication treatment or inability to arrange transportation to BD treatment clinical
             visits

          7. Concurrent medical condition or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the
             research psychiatrist, would interfere with the patient's ability to participate in
             the trial

          8. Current substance dependence

          9. High risk of harm to self or others
