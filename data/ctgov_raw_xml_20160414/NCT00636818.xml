    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to assess overall safety and tolerability as
      measured by discontinuation rate due to adverse events in doses up to 120 mg/day in relation
      to global clinical studies in adult subjects who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IVâ„¢) criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD).

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The definition of a study adverse event was any unfavorable medical event, newly emerged or a deterioration of a preexisting condition, in other words any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, without regard to the possibility of a causal relationship, that occurred after the visit for informed consent and up to the visit for completion of administration, or discontinuation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 17-item HAMD measures depression severity. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) or a 3-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, marked). The total score of HAMD-17 may range from 0 (normal) to 52 (severe).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 8 Week Endpoint in Stroop Color Word Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This was a psychological test to observe the interference in which disparity between the meaning and color affects reading speed. A subject was given 3 tasks of recognition: reading the printed colored ink (Color Test), reading color words in black ink (Word Test), and interference, reading color words printed in different colored ink (Word-Color Test). The test was scored on the number of correct answers. There were 100 items for each of the three categories and if they made it through the 100 words with time remaining, they would repeat the list.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SF-36 assesses quality of life (QoL) on 8 domains and 2 summary scores (mental component summary [MCS] and physical component summary [PCS]). MCS and PCS scores=0-100 (higher scores indicate better QoL). Raw domain scores: general health=5-25; physical functioning=10-30; role-physical=4-20; role-emotional=3-15; social functioning=2-10; bodily pain=2-12; vitality=4-20; mental health=5-25. Using norm based scores, all domains, MCS and PCS scores have average score of 50 with standard deviation of 10. Norm-based score=Z-score*10+50 in each subscale. Range cannot be specified in norm-based scores.</description>

        <description>This was a psychological test to observe the interference in which disparity between the meaning and color affects reading speed. A subject was given 3 tasks of recognition: reading the printed colored ink (Color Test), reading color words in black ink (Word Test), and interference, reading color words printed in different colored ink (Word-Color Test). The test was scored on the number of correct answers. There were 100 items for each of the three categories and if they made it through the 100 words with time remaining, they would repeat the list.</description>

        <description>SF-36 assesses quality of life (QoL) on 8 domains and 2 summary scores (mental component summary [MCS] and physical component summary [PCS]). MCS and PCS scores=0-100 (higher scores indicate better QoL). Raw domain scores: general health=5-25; physical functioning=10-30; role-physical=4-20; role-emotional=3-15; social functioning=2-10; bodily pain=2-12; vitality=4-20; mental health=5-25. Using norm based scores, all domains, MCS and PCS scores have average score of 50 with standard deviation of 10. Norm-based score=Z-score*10+50 in each subscale. Range cannot be specified in norm-based scores.</description>
