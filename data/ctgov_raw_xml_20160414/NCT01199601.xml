  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baseline information indicates there are measurable levels of hepatitis B SAg and low
      utilization of postpartum contraception, correct breastfeeding practices, or adherence to
      infant vaccination schedules in Kabul, Afghanistan. This intervention will randomize
      hospitals to assess the following aims:

      Aim 1: To determine whether the re-training and assignment of health care providers
      dedicated to intrapartum rapid testing and post-partum counseling will positively impact
      maternal and neonatal health indicators as compared to utilization of existing health
      providers for these services among women delivering in publish health maternity hospitals in
      Kabul, Afghanistan.

      Aim 2: To assess whether patients randomized to the intervention and their spouses perceive
      value in concentrated post-partum counseling.

      Aim 3: To investigate whether an intervention providing immediate post-partum provision of a
      long-acting family planning method would be feasible and acceptable to both men and women in
      Kabul, Afghanistan.

      Outcomes will be assessed through questionnaire responses and inspection of vaccination
      cards at six month intervals by trained study staff. The third aim will be addressed at the
      12 month follow-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline information indicates a measurable prevalence of hepatitis B SAg and low
      utilization of postpartum contraception, correct breastfeeding practices, or adherence to
      infant vaccination schedules in Kabul, Afghanistan. This intervention randomizes providers
      at maternity hospitals to assess the following aims:

      Aim 1: To determine whether the re-training and assignment of health care providers
      dedicated to intrapartum hepatitis B rapid testing and postpartum counseling will positively
      impact maternal and neonatal health indicators as compared to utilization of existing health
      providers for these services among women delivering in public health maternity hospitals in
      Kabul, Afghanistan.

      Aim 2: To assess whether patients randomized to the intervention and their spouses perceive
      value in concentrated postpartum counseling.

      Aim 3: To investigate whether an intervention providing immediate postpartum provision of a
      long-acting family planning method would be feasible and acceptable to both men and women in
      Kabul, Afghanistan.

      Outcomes are assessed through questionnaire responses and inspection of vaccination cards at
      six month intervals by trained study staff through one year total study time. Differences
      between groups will be assessed with generalized linear mixed modeling. Information obtained
      to address Aim 3 will be gathered at the 12 month follow-up and analyzed with simple
      proportions and Chi-square test to assess differences between sexes and other socioeconomic
      indicators.
