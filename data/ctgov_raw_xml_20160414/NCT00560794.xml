  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®)
      Blinatumomab (MT103) is effective in the treatment of ALL patients with minimal residual
      disease.

      The presence of leukemia cells below the cytological detection limit (5% leukemic cells) is
      defined as minimal residual disease (MRD). If no MRD is detectable (&lt; 10^-4 = less than 1
      leukemia cell per 10^4 bone marrow cells) a complete molecular remission is reached. In the
      last years a series of retrospective studies has shown that MRD in adult ALL is an
      independent prognostic factor as already demonstrated for childhood leukemia. Diagnostic
      tools for MRD are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or flow cytometry. PCR analysis can
      detect fusion transcripts such as bcr/abl and individual clonal rearrangements of
      immunoglobulins (IgH) and/or T-cell receptor genes (TCR). About 25% of patients with MRD
      defined by rearrangement comprise a high-risk group with a 94% relapse rate within 3 years.
      In general for patients with MRD, who are not eligible for allogenic stem cell
      transplantation, curative treatment is not available. This accounts for MRD defined by the
      Philadelphia chromosome translocation as well as for MRD defined by rearrangement. The
      current study is set up to address the question of treating MRD positive ALL with the
      bispecific anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 x anti-CD3 antibody derivative
      blinatumomab (MT103).

    <description>MRD Response is defined as:
If Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) positive (+) or translocation (t) (4;11), response was achieved when Ph or t(4;11) was below detection limit and individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes are below 10^-4.
If Ph and t(4;11) negative, response was achieved when individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes are below 10^-4.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The time to hematological relapse is defined as the time between start of first infusion of blinatumomab and the first result of hematological relapse. Participants without an event of hematological relapse were censored on their last available date of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy.
Hematological relapse is defined as &gt; 5% leukemia cells in bone marrow. Time to hematological relapse was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to the data cut-off date of 14 January 2010; Median follow-up time was 155 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Time to MRD progression is defined for participants who do not show MRD response at any time during the study as the time from start of first infusion until the first result of MRD progression or hematological relapse, if no MRD progression was diagnosed before hematological relapse. For participants who showed MRD response during the study the time to MRD progression is defined as the time from the date of the first MRD response to the date of MRD relapse. Participants without an event of MRD progression were censored on the day of their last bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. Participants who received a bone marrow transplant were censored on the last day of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy before transplantation.
MRD progression is defined as the increase in the MRD level by 1 log as compared to the baseline level (equal to a 10-fold increase in the number of MRD cells), and had to be confirmed within 6 weeks.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Time to MRD relapse is defined only for participants with an MRD response during the study, defined as the time between the date of the first MRD response and the date of MRD relapse. If a participant experienced hematological relapse without having shown MRD positivity before then the time point of MRD relapse is defined as the time point of hematological relapse. Participants without an event of MRD relapse or hematological relapse were censored on the day of their last available bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. If a participant received a bone marrow transplant the last day of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy before transplantation was used as time point for censoring.
MRD relapse is defined as reappearance of bcr/abl, and/or t(4;11) translocation at any detection level, and/or by individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes ≥10^-4 for at least 1 individual marker measured by an assay with a sensitivity of minimum 10^-4 and should be confirmed within 6 weeks.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The severity (or intensity) of AEs was evaluated according to the grading scale provided in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0, or according to the following: Grade 1 - Mild AE; Grade 2 - Moderate AE; Grade 3 - Severe AE; Grade 4 - Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 - Death.
The investigator used medical judgment to determine if there was a causal relationship (ie, related, unrelated) between an adverse event and blinatumomab.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. In addition, all laboratory abnormalities of grade four severity that occur during or after administration of the investigational drug, any overdose and a pregnancy or fathering were reported as SAEs.</description>

        <title>Time to MRD Progression</title>
        <description>Time to MRD progression is defined for participants who do not show MRD response at any time during the study as the time from start of first infusion until the first result of MRD progression or hematological relapse, if no MRD progression was diagnosed before hematological relapse. For participants who showed MRD response during the study the time to MRD progression is defined as the time from the date of the first MRD response to the date of MRD relapse. Participants without an event of MRD progression were censored on the day of their last bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. Participants who received a bone marrow transplant were censored on the last day of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy before transplantation.
MRD progression is defined as the increase in the MRD level by 1 log as compared to the baseline level (equal to a 10-fold increase in the number of MRD cells), and had to be confirmed within 6 weeks.</description>

            <title>Time to MRD Progression</title>
            <description>Time to MRD progression is defined for participants who do not show MRD response at any time during the study as the time from start of first infusion until the first result of MRD progression or hematological relapse, if no MRD progression was diagnosed before hematological relapse. For participants who showed MRD response during the study the time to MRD progression is defined as the time from the date of the first MRD response to the date of MRD relapse. Participants without an event of MRD progression were censored on the day of their last bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. Participants who received a bone marrow transplant were censored on the last day of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy before transplantation.
MRD progression is defined as the increase in the MRD level by 1 log as compared to the baseline level (equal to a 10-fold increase in the number of MRD cells), and had to be confirmed within 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Time to MRD Relapse</title>
        <description>Time to MRD relapse is defined only for participants with an MRD response during the study, defined as the time between the date of the first MRD response and the date of MRD relapse. If a participant experienced hematological relapse without having shown MRD positivity before then the time point of MRD relapse is defined as the time point of hematological relapse. Participants without an event of MRD relapse or hematological relapse were censored on the day of their last available bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. If a participant received a bone marrow transplant the last day of bone marrow aspiration/biopsy before transplantation was used as time point for censoring.
MRD relapse is defined as reappearance of bcr/abl, and/or t(4;11) translocation at any detection level, and/or by individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes ≥10^-4 for at least 1 individual marker measured by an assay with a sensitivity of minimum 10^-4 and should be confirmed within 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>The severity (or intensity) of AEs was evaluated according to the grading scale provided in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0, or according to the following: Grade 1 – Mild AE; Grade 2 – Moderate AE; Grade 3 - Severe AE; Grade 4 - Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 - Death.
The investigator used medical judgment to determine if there was a causal relationship (ie, related, unrelated) between an adverse event and blinatumomab.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. In addition, all laboratory abnormalities of grade four severity that occur during or after administration of the investigational drug, any overdose and a pregnancy or fathering were reported as SAEs.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
