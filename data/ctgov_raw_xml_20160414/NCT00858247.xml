  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions nationally as well as
      internationally. Currently, 16 % of American adolescents are obese. In adults, obesity is a
      risk factor for vitamin D insufficiency and up to 80% of obese adults have been noted to
      vitamin D insufficient. In adults, low vitamin D status appears to be associated with the
      development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. There is little information on the
      prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and its implications in obese adolescents.
      Additionally, it is unknown whether treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in adolescents
      might result in improvement in insulin resistance, lipids and cardiovascular risk markers.

      We hypothesize that vitamin D insufficiency correlates positively with insulin resistance
      and cardiovascular risk in obese adolescents and that vitamin D3 supplementation improves
      insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in this population. The purpose of the
      study is to determine the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on various parameters of
      insulin secretion, insulin action, lipids and C-reactive protein in obese adolescents.

    <textblock>
      The problem of childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions both nationally and
      internationally. The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last three decades and
      currently 16 % of American adolescents are obese. Nearly 30% of obese adolescents
      demonstrate a metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. These
      abnormalities lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for vitamin D
      insufficiency and up to 80% of obese adults have been found to be insufficient in vitamin D.
      Observational studies in adults have shown consistent associations between low vitamin D
      status and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. There is paucity
      of data on the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and its implications in obese
      adolescents. It is also not known whether treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in children
      or adults might result in improvement in insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors.

      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that vitamin D insufficiency correlates positively with insulin
      resistance and cardiovascular risk in obese adolescents and that vitamin D3 supplementation
      decreases insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in this population.

      Objectives:

        1. Determine if there is any correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and homeostasis
           model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HDL cholesterol and C-reactive
           protein, in obese adolescents.

        2. Study the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on various parameters reflecting insulin
           action, secretion, lipids and C-reactive protein in obese adolescents.

    <description>Insulin resistance (IR) is a physiological condition in which cells fail to respond to the normal actions of the hormone insulin. The body produces insulin, but the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to hyperglycemia. Beta cells in the pancreas subsequently increase their production of insulin, further contributing to hyperinsulinemia.
From the fasting glucose and insulin measurements, insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) as: HOMA -IR = fasting insulin concentration (µU/mL) x fasting glucose concentration (mmol/L)/22.5. High HOMA-IR scores denote increased insulin resistance.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>LDL cholesterol is considered to be the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. Less than 100 mg/dL is optimal, &gt;130 mg/dL is borderline high, &gt;160 mg/dL is high, &gt;190 mg/dL is very high.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>HDL (good) cholesterol protects against heart disease, so for HDL, higher numbers are better. A level less than 40 mg/dL is low and is considered a major risk factor because it increases your risk for developing heart disease. HDL levels of 60 mg/dL or more help to lower your risk for heart disease.</description>

        <title>Change in Insulin Resistance After 12 Weeks of Vitamin D3 Supplementation</title>
        <description>Insulin resistance (IR) is a physiological condition in which cells fail to respond to the normal actions of the hormone insulin. The body produces insulin, but the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to hyperglycemia. Beta cells in the pancreas subsequently increase their production of insulin, further contributing to hyperinsulinemia.
From the fasting glucose and insulin measurements, insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) as: HOMA -IR = fasting insulin concentration (µU/mL) x fasting glucose concentration (mmol/L)/22.5. High HOMA-IR scores denote increased insulin resistance.</description>

        <population>All subjects had blood drawn but some tests such as insulin could not be done in some cases due to sample issues. This lab test was calculated from other parameters and not drawn per se. If the values obtained did not allow a calculation of the lab test, then the results could not be reported.</population>
