  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 26-week, prospective double-blind, randomized pilot trial of nebivolol versus an
      active control, metoprolol succinate, in patients with established lower-extremity
      peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and at least moderate risk for coronary artery
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects up to an estimated 16-29% of men and women over
      age 50, and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and death in
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are indicated for the treatment of
      hypertension in patients with PAD. However, there is a theoretical risk that
      antihypertensive therapy may decrease limb perfusion pressure and therefore exacerbate
      symptoms of claudication or limb ischemia. Patients with CAD and concomitant PAD are less
      likely to be prescribed beta-blockers, even though most patients are able to tolerate
      antihypertensive therapy without worsening of symptoms.

      The third generation beta-blocker, nebivolol, has vasodilating properties in addition to
      beta-adrenergic blockade. This vasodilatory effect is mediated through the L-arginine-nitric
      oxide-dependent pathway. Nitric oxide is a critical modulator of vascular disease with
      effects that lead to vasodilatation, endothelial regeneration, inhibition of leukocyte
      chemotaxis and inhibition of platelet adhesion. This combination of beta-blockade and nitric
      oxide-dependent vasodilation may enhance effectiveness and tolerability of nebivolol versus
      other beta-blockers in patients with hypertension, CAD or high-risk state, and PAD.

      This study will be a pilot comparative effectiveness study to examine the effect of
      nebivolol versus metoprolol succinate in patients with lower-extremity PAD and at least
      moderate risk for CAD on PAD symptoms as measured by both functional and quality of life
      measures.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change in distance score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score subscale. The degree of difficulty in the walking of specific distances is ranked on a 0 to 4 Likert scale, in which 0 represents the inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty. A Likert scale is an ordinal scale of consecutive, equidistant, numerical values (ie, 0 to 4). The distances assessed in the WIQ range from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks (1500 feet). The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of walking. The distance score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>Change in speed score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) speed score subscale. In the walking speed component, the degree of difficulty walking is ranked on a 0 to 4 scale where speed is assessed for each of the following speeds: at the following speeds: 1, slowly; 2, average speed; 3, quickly; or 4, running or jogging 1 block. Zero represents the inability to walk the specified speed, and 4 represents no difficulty. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The speed score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>Change in stairs score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) stairs subscale. This scale item asks the subject to describe the degree of difficulty climbing one, two, or three flights of stairs in the past week. A flight of stairs is defined as 14 steps. A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, 5) Unable to Do, or 6) Didn Do for Other Reasons. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The stairs score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

        <title>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change in WIQ Distance Score</title>
        <description>Change in distance score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score subscale. The degree of difficulty in the walking of specific distances is ranked on a 0 to 4 Likert scale, in which 0 represents the inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty. A Likert scale is an ordinal scale of consecutive, equidistant, numerical values (ie, 0 to 4). The distances assessed in the WIQ range from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks (1500 feet). The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of walking. The distance score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

        <description>Change in speed score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) speed score subscale. In the walking speed component, the degree of difficulty walking is ranked on a 0 to 4 scale where speed is assessed for each of the following speeds: at the following speeds: 1, slowly; 2, average speed; 3, quickly; or 4, running or jogging 1 block. Zero represents the inability to walk the specified speed, and 4 represents no difficulty. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The speed score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>
