  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a mixture of 9 east Indian herbs known
      as Cystone regarding their ability to dissolve existing kidney stones and prevent formation
      of new ones. Cystine and calcium stone formers will be recruited for a 59 week trial. The
      first phase of the study will be two 6 weeks periods during which each subject will receive
      Cystone or placebo in random order (with a one-week wash out between 6 week treatment
      periods). The remaining 46 weeks, each subject will receive Cystone. End points are changes
      in urinary chemistries and stone burden by Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystone will be used in proven cystine and calcium stone forming adults who are not
      pregnant. Subjects must have a measurable stone by CT. The first phase is a double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled cross-over of Cystone and placebo for 6 weeks each separated
      by a 1 week washout. Entry, 6 and 12 week 24 hour urine supersaturations or cystine, pH and
      sodium determinations will be collected. Then all patients enter an open label phase of 46
      weeks, ensuring a 52-week total exposure to Cystone during the 59 week study. Baseline and 1
      year stone quantification CT scans will be performed. End points will be changes in urine
      chemistry/supersaturation and stone burden. Stone burden was measured by CT, quantitatively
      for stone density and volume. All CT images were also reviewed in a blinded fashion by a
      radiologist to score each kidney as increased, no change or decreased stone burden.

      Statistics and Randomization: Randomization was accomplished using a table provided by the
      department of statistics to the study coordinator who was blinded as to whether the patients
      received placebo or Cystone®. Biochemical and supersaturation results were analyzed via a
      matched pair analysis using the JMP software package (SAS Instituted, Inc.); P values &lt; 0.05
      were deemed significant.

    <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate.</description>

        <title>24 Hour Urine Supersaturation of Calcium Oxalate (CaOx)</title>
        <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events. Power of the study was diminished by failure of patients to return all required 24 hour urine samples. The botanical authenticity of Cystone was not documented.</limitations_and_caveats>
