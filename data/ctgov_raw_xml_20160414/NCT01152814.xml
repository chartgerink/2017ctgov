    <time_frame>day 22</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay. Seroconversion: proportion of participants with negative pre-vaccination serum and a post-vaccination serum area ≥ 25 mm2. Significant increase: proportion of participants with at least a 50% increase in area from positive pre-vaccination serum. Seroconversion or significant increase: proportion of participants with either seroconversion or significant increase.
The European (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP]) criterion is met, if percentage of participants achieving seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area is 30% (≥65 years).</description>

    <description>Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of participants was calculated as the ratio of post-vaccination to pre-vaccination SRH geometric mean areas (GMAs), directed against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after FLUAD vaccination (day 22).
The CHMP criterion was met if the geometric mean increase (GMR, day 22/day 1) in SRH antibody area is &gt;2.0 (≥65 years).</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of participants achieving SRH area ≥25 mm2 against each of the three vaccine strains at baseline (day 1) and three weeks after FLUAD vaccination (day 22).
This criterion is met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of participants achieving SRH area ≥25 mm2 is 60% (≥65 years).</description>

        <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay. Seroconversion: proportion of participants with negative pre-vaccination serum and a post-vaccination serum area ≥ 25 mm2. Significant increase: proportion of participants with at least a 50% increase in area from positive pre-vaccination serum. Seroconversion or significant increase: proportion of participants with either seroconversion or significant increase.
