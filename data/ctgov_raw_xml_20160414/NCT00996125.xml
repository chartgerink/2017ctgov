    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GlaxoSmithKline
      Biologicals' human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in pre-teen and adolescent female subjects
      aged 9 - 17 years. One group of subjects will receive the HPV vaccine and the other group
      will receive the control.

    <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti- HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination. Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti- HPV-18 antibodies.</description>

    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal, headache, myalgia, rash, urticaria and fever (= axillary temperature above 37.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 fever = axillary temperature above 39.0°C. Grade 3 urticaria = urticaria distributed on at least 4 body areas. For other symptoms, any = occurrence of any general symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and grade 3 = a general symptom that prevented normal activity.

    <description>Medically significant conditions (MSCs) are defined as: adverse events (AEs) prompting emergency room or physician visits that are not (1) related to common diseases or (2) routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, or serious adverse events (SAEs) that are not related to common diseases. Common diseases include: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury.
MSCs were collected regardless of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days (Days 0 - 29) after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 was an event that prevented normal activities and related was defined as an unsolicited AE assessed by the investigator to be causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

            <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti- HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination. Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti- HPV-18 antibodies.</description>
