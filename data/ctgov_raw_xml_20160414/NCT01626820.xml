    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, shivering, sweating and fever [oral temperature ≥38.0 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Any =occurrence of any specified solicited general symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination, Any fever = oral temperature ≥38.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature ≥39.0°C.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <description>SAEs assessed included medical occurrences that resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>
