    <textblock>
      Tissue oxygen saturation is non-invasively measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, by two
      device, INVOS®(somanetics Corporation, USA ) and InSpectra™ (Hutchinson Technology, USA).
      Each probes are attached to both thenar muscles and vascular occlusion test (VOT) is
      performed. The investigators will compare the Invos® data to InSpectra™ to investigate
      whether tissue oxygen saturation values by INVOS® can substitute for InSpectra™.

      Tissue oxygen saturation is non-invasively measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, by two
      device, INVOS®(somanetics Corporation, USA ) and InSpectra™ (Hutchinson Technology, USA).
      InSpectra™ was introduced later than INVOS®.

      With InSpectra™, clinicians have used a vascular occlusion test (VOT) to evaluate dynamic
      changes in tissue oxygen saturation during ischemia and reperfusion, and thus,
      microcirculatory function. There have been little data about VOT using INVOS®, although it
      is more popular device.

      We hypothesized that there would be a difference between the values from INVOS® and
      InSpectra™. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue oxygen saturation in the
      thenar muscle during VOT using INVOS® and comapre it to InSpectra™ in a normal population.

    <description>The pediatric SomaSensor™ probe of INVOS® and the 15-mm sensor of InSpectra™ are placed on each thenar muscle in the same subject. The side on which the probe will be placed is randomly determined. INVOS® updates data every 5 s and data (SrO2) will be manually recorded. The data of InSpectra™ (StO2) are automatically collected and sampled every 2 s.
Vascular occlusion test (VOT) is done as follows:Adult-size blood pressure cuffs are placed around each upper arm. The both cuffs are simultaneously inflated to 30 mmHg above the initial systolic blood pressure and kept inflated until the SrO2 or StO2 decreased to 40%. When the value reaches 40% or just below it, the cuff on the same side is deflated rapidly. The data will be collected until the SrO2 and StO2 values returned to the baseline.</description>

          <title>Vascular Occlusion Test</title>
          <description>The pediatric SomaSensor™ probe of INVOS® and the 15-mm sensor of InSpectra™ are placed on each thenar muscle in the same subject. The side on which the probe will be placed is randomly determined. INVOS® updates data every 5 s and data (SrO2) will be manually recorded. The data of InSpectra™ (StO2) are automatically collected and sampled every 2 s.
Vascular occlusion test (VOT) is done as follows:Adult-size blood pressure cuffs are placed around each upper arm. The both cuffs are simultaneously inflated to 30 mmHg above the initial systolic blood pressure and kept inflated until the SrO2 or StO2 decreased to 40%. When the value reaches 40% or just below it, the cuff on the same side is deflated rapidly. The data will be collected until the SrO2 and StO2 values returned to the baseline.</description>
