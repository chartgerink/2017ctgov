  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of the study is the evaluation of the safety of treatment with
      moxifloxacin in a pediatric population 3 months to &lt;18 years old. Approximately 450
      pediatric subjects with a complicated intra-abdominal infection will be enrolled in the
      study and treated with either moxifloxacin intravenously and orally if switched to oral
      therapy or ertapenem (intravenously) and, if switched to oral therapy,
      amoxicillin/clavulanate.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.

            <description>Clinical responses during therapy visit were graded as clinical improvement, clinical failure, or indeterminate. Clinical improvement defined as a reduction in the severity and/or the number of signs and symptoms of infection; 'clinical failure' defined as a failure to respond or insufficient lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection requiring a modification or addition of antibacterial therapy.
'Indeterminate' defined as those subjects in whom a clinical assessment is not possible to determine (eg, due to early withdrawal from the study because of adverse events, protocol violation, withdrawn consent, receipt of an effective concomitant antibacterial for an indication other than the study indication and receipt of less than 3 full days of study drug, etc). Percentage of subjects with clinical response during therapy visit were reported.</description>
