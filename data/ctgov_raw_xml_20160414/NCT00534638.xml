  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital infections with oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are common in both men and
      women. The most important disease associated with oncogenic HPV infection is cervical
      cancer, currently the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women globally. The
      current study is designed to evaluate the overall impact of HPV immunization in adolescents
      12-15 years of age.

      This protocol posting has been updated following protocol amendment 09, 24 March 2014. The
      sections impacted are secondary objectives, endpoints, final analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participants who the investigator or delegate believes that they and/or their
             parents/legally acceptable representative can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits)
             should be enrolled in the study.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 12 and 15 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

        A written informed assent must be obtained from all study participants prior to enrolment.
        In addition, a written informed consent must be obtained from the study participants'
        parent or legally acceptable representative.

        Note: As according to the Finnish law legal age of consent is 15 years, a written informed
        consent form can be obtained from study participants aged 15 years old and their
        parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) will receive a letter informing them of
        their child participation to the study.

          -  Healthy male and female study participants as established by medical history before
             entering into the study. If needed, a history-directed clinical examination will be
             performed by the investigator or delegate (e.g. study nurse).

          -  Study participants must not be pregnant. Absence of pregnancy should be verified
             (e.g. urine pregnancy test) as per investigator's or delegate's clinical judgement.

          -  If the study participant is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e.
             be abstinent, have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be
             post-menopausal or pre-menarcheal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must
             use adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination and continue for 2 months
             after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous vaccination against HPV or Hepatitis B virus.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of
             a moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered
             to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection
             with or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e. Oral temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F) /
             Axillary temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F) / Rectal temperature &lt;38°C (100.4°F).)

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

      <recruitment_details>Immunisation phase (Visit 1 at Day 0 to Phone contact at Month 12) = adolescents (birth cohorts 1992-95) were vaccinated with Cervarix™ or Engerix™-B vaccine.
Effectiveness evaluation phase (Visit 5) = the impact of the vaccine intervention was assessed on female subjects of approximately 18.5 years of age.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At study start, Cervarix™ vaccine was not licensed for use in boys so male subjects receiving the vaccine were considered as part of a Phase III trial.

            <description>The antibody concentrations against HPV-16 and HPV-18 were determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cut-off of the assay was 8 ELISA units per millilitre (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 and 7 EL.U/mL for anti-HPV-18 at Visits 1 and 4 and 19 EL.U/mL for HPV-16 and 18 EL.U/mL for HPV-18 at Visit 5. The Immunogenicity subset comprised the male study participants from the Cervarix/Engerix-B A Group plus female study participants from the same Cervarix/Engerix-B A Group.</description>
