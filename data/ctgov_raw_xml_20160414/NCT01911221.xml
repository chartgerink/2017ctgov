               -  Receipt of any chronic immunostimulants

               -  Immune deficiency disorder, or known HIV infection

          9. Subjects who are not able to comprehend and to follow all required study procedures
             for the whole period of the study;

         10. History or any illness/condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subjects due
             to participation in the study;

         11. Any significant chronic infection;

         12. Known bleeding diathesis or any condition that may be associated with a prolonged
             bleeding time;
