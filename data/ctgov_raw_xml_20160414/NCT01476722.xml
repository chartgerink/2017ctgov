    <measure>Corneal Fluorescein Staining Type at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Corneal staining type was assessed by the investigator for each of 5 regions of the cornea, i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled fluorescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and a yellow filter. Corneal staining type was recorded on a 5-point scale for each region: 0-none; 1-micropunctate; 2-macropunctate; 3-coalesced macropunctate; 4-patch (&gt;/= 1mm). The five regions were summed, for a maximum score of 20. A lower score represents a more desirable outcome.</description>

            <title>Corneal Fluorescein Staining Area at Baseline</title>
            <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator for each of five regions of the cornea, i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled fluorescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and a yellow filter. The area (extent) of corneal staining for each of the five areas was estimated [i.e., 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region)], for a maximum score of 100% per eye. A lower score represents a more desirable outcome.</description>
