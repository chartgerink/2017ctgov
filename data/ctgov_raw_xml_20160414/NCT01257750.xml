  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug [Pazopanib
      (Votrient)] as a treatment for corneal neovascularization. The cornea is the clear, central
      portion of the eye and neovascularization means blood vessel growth. The cornea is typically
      avascular, or without blood vessels. Corneal neovascularization in the cornea and can put
      vision at risk. Numerous diseases of the cornea such as inflammation, ischemia (restriction
      of blood supply), infection, degeneration (or deterioration), trauma, or corneal stem cell
      deficiency can lead to corneal neovascularization. This major ocular complication can lead
      to corneal scarring, edema (swelling), lipid deposits, and inflammation that may
      significantly alter your vision. In addition, it worsens the outcome of potential future
      treatments, such as a corneal transplant. A corneal transplant is a treatment that many
      patients with severe corneal disease may ultimately need.

    <textblock>
      Normally avascular, under many pathologic conditions, vessels may invade the cornea from the
      limbal vascular plexus. Infection, inflammation, ischemia, degeneration, or trauma, and the
      loss of the limbal stem cell barrier can cause corneal neovascularization. Growth of new
      vessels may result in corneal scarring, edema, lipid deposition, and inflammation that may
      alter visual acuity and is a leading cause of monocular visual impairment and blindness.
      Additionally, it results in the loss of immune response across the cornea, thereby worsening
      the prognosis of a subsequent penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Growth of new blood and
      lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels are mediated by members of the vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. In previous studies, inhibition of new blood or
      lymphatic vessels has been achieved by neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor
      A (VEGF-A). It has also been shown that platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) plays a
      role in corneal and choroidal neovascularization by regulating mural cell recruitment.
      Inhibition of PDGF-B and VEGF-A signaling pathways has shown to more effectively promote
      vessel regression than solely inhibiting VEGF-A. Pazopanib is a drug designed to block these
      pathways, stop new growth, and regress old vessel growth.
