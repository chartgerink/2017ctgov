  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency of
      the vaccine, to address the relevant concomitant vaccine administrations and to provide a
      comparison between GSK Biologicals' Hib conjugate vaccine and the licensed monovalent Hib
      vaccine ActHIB as well as the licensed combination product Pentacel in infants at 2, 4, 6
      and 15-18 months of age. This study is designed with a primary and a booster phase.

            <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>
