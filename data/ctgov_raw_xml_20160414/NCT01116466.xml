  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and other developed
      countries and a major source of disability. Prognosis for regaining the ability to walk is
      good, with 64% of those initially dependent in walking regaining independence by 3 months.
      However, many gait abnormalities persist. A conservative estimate suggests that 20% of
      stroke survivors have a drop foot. Drop foot following stroke is caused by paresis of the
      ankle dorsiflexor muscles. It prevents the patient from effectively swinging the leg during
      walking, causing an abnormal gait characterized by hip hitching and circumduction and toe
      catch. Walking speed in people with drop foot is often significantly reduced and the risk of
      stumbling or falling is high. The conventional treatment for drop foot is an ankle-foot
      orthosis (AFO). While AFOs are appropriate for many patients, in certain patient groups AFOs
      have significant limitations (e.g. in patients with strong spasticity, suffering from
      pronounced inversion, suffering from volume changes in the lower extremity, etc). An
      alternative way of treating drop foot is by means of functional electrical stimulation.
      Clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of drop foot stimulation suggest that it
      provides many benefits to patients, such as an improved confidence in walking, increased
      walking speed and endurance, less effort during walking and reduced spasticity. Implantable
      systems such as ActiGait are considered therapeutic alternatives specifically for those
      patients for whom conventional treatments have failed. ActiGait system consists of an
      external module (antenna and control module), a foot switch transmitting to the external
      module and an implanted assembly (receiver, pulse train generator, electrodes). The
      objective of this study is to obtain additional evidence on safety of ActiGait implantation
      procedure and on its efficacy. The study will enrol 5 subjects that will be implanted and
      followed for 12 weeks. Efficacy outcomes will be assessed at the baseline and during two
      follow-up visits (week 6 and 12). Subjects will be asked to walk with and without their
      preferred walking at the baseline and with and without stimulation at follow-up visits.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A semi-structured interview is conducted in order to identify subject's limitations with daily occupations of importance in categories self-care, productivtiy or leisure. The subject is then asked to rate the imporance of each of the occupations using a 10-point rating scale. Afterwards the subject chooses up to 5 of the most important occupations (problems) (basis for identifying intervention goals). The subject is asked to use a 10 point scale to rate level of performance and satisfaction with performance for each of the five identified problems. Average COPM performance score and satisfaction score are calculated. The scores range between 1 and 10, where 1 indicates poor performance and low satisfaction, respectively, while 10 indicates very good performance and high satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) Score</title>
        <description>A semi-structured interview is conducted in order to identify subject's limitations with daily occupations of importance in categories self-care, productivtiy or leisure. The subject is then asked to rate the imporance of each of the occupations using a 10-point rating scale. Afterwards the subject chooses up to 5 of the most important occupations (problems) (basis for identifying intervention goals). The subject is asked to use a 10 point scale to rate level of performance and satisfaction with performance for each of the five identified problems. Average COPM performance score and satisfaction score are calculated. The scores range between 1 and 10, where 1 indicates poor performance and low satisfaction, respectively, while 10 indicates very good performance and high satisfaction.</description>
