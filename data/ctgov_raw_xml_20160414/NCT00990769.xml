  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether depth of anesthesia has an effect on
      emergence agitation (EA) in children age 2 - 8 years old. EA is a common problem in
      pediatric patients who receive general anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics, and the effect
      of depth of anesthesia on EA has not been studied. The study will randomize 40 children
      undergoing ophthalmologic surgery under general anesthesia to either light anesthesia (BIS
      55-60) or deep anesthesia (BIS 40-45). EA will be measured by the peak Pediatric Assessment
      of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score in the recovery room, which rates agitation behaviors on
      a scale of 0 - 20. The hypothesis is that light anesthesia is associated with more EA.

    <description>The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of five aspects of child behavior on emergence from anesthesia (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to arrive at a total score ranging from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater severity of emergence agitation.</description>

    <description>Pain was assessed with the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. The FLACC scale is an observational measure of child behavior in response to postoperative pain. Five subscales are rated from 0-2 on severity: facial expression, leg position and motion, psychomotor agitation, crying, and inconsolability. Subscale scores are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0-10, with 10 representing the most severe pain. In the post-operative setting, the FLACC scale is validated for cognitively intact children up to age 7 years, and was used for all children in the study.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Parents or guardians of children undergoing ophthalmologic surgery were approached, when possible, at their pre-anesthesia evaluation visit. All eligible patients were notified about the study through fliers at their pre-operative visit, and eligible patients who were missed pre-operatively were approached for consent on the day of surgery.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Fifty-seven patients were approached for participation; of these, fourteen declined and three were unable to participate due to surgery cancellation or rescheduling.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pain Score: Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC)</title>
        <description>Pain was assessed with the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. The FLACC scale is an observational measure of child behavior in response to postoperative pain. Five subscales are rated from 0-2 on severity: facial expression, leg position and motion, psychomotor agitation, crying, and inconsolability. Subscale scores are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0-10, with 10 representing the most severe pain. In the post-operative setting, the FLACC scale is validated for cognitively intact children up to age 7 years, and was used for all children in the study.</description>
