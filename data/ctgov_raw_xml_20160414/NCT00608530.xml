      This double blind, randomized, parallel groups, two arm, six month clinical trial. Patients
      will have chronic low back pain of non-neoplastic origin. Patients will be randomized to one
      of two conditions, either Cognitive Behavioral Training or Rogerian psychotherapy; both
      conditions are home-based, telephone supported, with 10 hours of contact time delivered over
      8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a major medical problem for the VA, affecting up to 15% of
      all veterans in primary care. Furthermore, prior surveys indicate CLBP is a leading cause of
      medical discharge of active duty personnel, and of medical disability costs. Given current
      demands on military personnel it is likely the burden of chronic pain will increase. The VA
      has adopted the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines for evaluation of back
      pain but these guidelines do not provide specifics for true rehabilitation. It is
      acknowledged that most back pain patients are not surgical candidates, that medications
      provide only limited analgesia, and that symptom control and improved function require a
      comprehensive approach addressing the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of
      chronic pain. Fortunately, structured, specific interventions to both address the
      multidimensional nature of pain and operationalize treatment principles in primary care
      settings are available. These interventions, which reflect the VA emphasis on
      patient-centered care, can be effective in reducing disability and pain, but are a
      frequently overlooked component of effective care. One reason is that most clinics lack
      appropriately trained specialists. Moreover, even when specialists are available, the
      prevailing clinic-based service model is either too resource-intensive, or presents barriers
      to access.

      One approach to addressing some these barriers is the use of &quot;telehealth&quot; outreach. Studies
      in diverse medical disorders and some chronic pain syndromes suggest that care can be
      delivered efficiently and effectively with minimal therapist contact in home-based treatment
      models, using telephone consultation to replace clinic visits. These approaches are fully
      congruent with recent VA telehealth initiatives to improve access and cost efficiency. In VA
      Pain Clinic settings our face-to-face, 8-week, 8-hours contact time Cogntive Behavioral
      Self-Managment Skills Training (CBSST) program appears to be effective in reducing
      disability and pain, and improving mood in chronic back pain.

      We propose a double blind, randomized assignment, two-arm, parallel groups, six month
      clinical trial. Patients with CLBP will be recruited from VA San Diego primary care clinics
      and the community. Subjects will receive either CBSST (N = 65) or Rogerian Psychotherapy
      (N=65) in a home-based, telephone delivered format for a total of 10 hours of therapist
      contact time. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at end of treatment, and at one,
      three and six months post-treatment. The primary data analytic strategy will be an
      intent-to-treat analysis (last observation carried forward) of all participants as
      randomized. The primary end point will be physical function (Roland &amp; Morris Disability) at
      end of 8-week treatment; secondary end points will be pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale)
      and patient-reported clinical global impression of change. Supplemental analyses will be
      conducted to test for durability of therapeutic effect at one, three, and six month
      post-treatment. Rigorously controlled clinical trials of the type we propose could
      contribute to more effective and more cost-efficient back pain treatment.

    <description>The Roland and Morris is a 24-item self-report measure of interference of back pain on everyday function at the present time. Each item is qualified by the phrase &quot;because of my back pain&quot; (e.g., &quot;Because of my back I walk more slowly than usual . . . ; Because of my back I lie down to rest more often&quot;). Scoring the measure involves summing the number of items endorsed (from 0 to 24). Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 18-75 inclusive;

          2. chronic musculoskeletal low back pain (pain &quot;on a daily basis&quot; for at least six
             months) as the primary pain problem;

          3. not eligible for back surgery;

          4. presently lives in the San Diego area and will do so six months after baseline
             examination;

          5. English-speaking, literate, with stable residence and phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major medical illness (e.g., insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy or
             &quot;poor control&quot;, heart disease with New York Heart Association Functional Class III or
             IV, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen which
             might confound effects of pain on function);

          2. candidate for spine surgery;

          3. back pain associated with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, neoplastic disease,
             osteomyelitis, or neural arch lesions, since their treatment and prognosis differs
             from the usual back pain population, or spinal stenosis, since increased physical
             activity would be contraindicated;

          4. history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV bipolar disorder, dementia, or
             schizophrenia;

          5. current active DSM-IV diagnosed alcohol or non-prescribed substance dependence;

          6. current active DSM-IV major depressive episode or post-traumatic stress disorder
             since specialty mental health care would be indicated;

          7. non-opioid and opioid analgesics are permitted, except we will exclude patients on a
             hospital-initiated opioid treatment &quot;contract,&quot; since at this medical center
             &quot;contracting&quot; identifies patients with history of opioid diversion, multiple VA and
             non-VA opioid prescribers, and repeated dose escalation in the absence of evidence of
             disease progression.

            <title>Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire</title>
            <description>The Roland and Morris is a 24-item self-report measure of interference of back pain on everyday function at the present time. Each item is qualified by the phrase &quot;because of my back pain&quot; (e.g., &quot;Because of my back I walk more slowly than usual . . . ; Because of my back I lie down to rest more often&quot;). Scoring the measure involves summing the number of items endorsed (from 0 to 24). Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>
