  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer.
      The infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared, can lead to
      cervical cancer in women. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the GSK
      Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (Cervarix TM) vaccine.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

            <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti-HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination.
Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti-HPV-18 antibodies.</description>
