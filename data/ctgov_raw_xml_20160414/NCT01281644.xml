  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to establish whether or not the diode laser, a longer-wavelength
      laser, is effective in treating keratosis pilaris, and hopefully opening a door into the
      discussion and management of this skin condition. The primary outcome of interest is the
      difference in the overall blind rater severity scores of the treated versus the untreated
      sites. The secondary outcome of interest is the change in the patient's self-rated severity
      score of the treated site. To account for potential natural disease progression or
      regression, the investigators will also compare patient mean changes to the mean changes in
      severity scores of the untreated site.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was the difference in disease severity total score, combining redness and roughness/bumpiness scales, between the treated site and the control site, as rated by the blinded dermatologists at 12 weeks post-initial visit. These scales were not validated, as no relevant validated scale was available. However, raters were trained and calibrated on the use of the scale, and prior to review of study images, were asked to rate archival skin images on the same 4-point qualitative subscales used in the study. Each scale ranged from 0 to 3, with 0 being none and 3 being severe. The total score summed the redness and roughness/bumpiness scale scores for a range of 0 (none/better outcome) to 6 (severe/worse outcome).</description>
