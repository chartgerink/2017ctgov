  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluated the usefulness of the Glidescope(GVL) compared with direct
      laryngoscopy in patients whose airway management are anticipated difficult (C&amp;L grade ≥3) by
      comparing the laryngoscopic view. Also, the investigators compared the effectiveness of
      smaller-size blade of GVL (GVLs) with standard blade of GVL selected by patient's weight
      (GVLw) in the same patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We assumed that smaller sized GVL can slide more angulated along the tongue, so the tip of a
      blade can be placed more anterior and cephalad. The angle of camera would be optimized by
      inserting the blade further with the blade tip directed toward the larynx. This optimization
      may be more remarkable with smaller blade because it can be inserted with rotation.
      Furthermore, the location and the angle of camera are different according to GVL blade size.
      Considering that patient with difficult airway has hypognathia and more cephalad larynx, it
      may be helpful with smaller sized GVL (GVLs) rather than GVL selected by weight (GVLw) for
      improvement of laryngoscopic view in patients with difficult airways. We hypothesized that
      GVLs can provide better laryngoscopic view than GVLw and DL in patient with difficult
      airway.

    <description>Glottis view was scored using C&amp;L grade by Macintosh laryngoscope and GVL selected by weight, and compared each other.
We used modified C&amp;L grade: grade 1, all or most of the glottic aperture was visible; grade 2a, posterior cords and cartilage visible; grade 2b, only posterior cartilage visible; grade 3a, epiglottis visible and can be lifted; grade 3b, epiglottis adherent to the posterior pharynx; and grade 4, the epiglottis could not be visualized.
For the statistical analysis, the modified C&amp;L grade was converted to an ordinal scale; grade 1 to 1, grade 2a to 2, grade 2b to 3, grade 3a to 4, grade 3b to 5, and grade 4 to 6. Therefore, score range for the data reported in the table was between 1 and 6, with 1 representing best view and 6 representing no view.</description>

            <description>Glottis view was scored using C&amp;L grade by GVL selected by weight and smaller sized GVL, and compared each other.
Score range for the data reported in the table was between 1 and 6, with 1 representing best view and 6 representing no view.</description>

            <groups_desc>An improvement of C&amp;L grade ordinal scale by 2 was considered a clinically significant change. The mean difference of C&amp;L grade ordinal scale between DL and GVLw was 1.3, and its standard deviation was 2.0 in our pilot study. The required sample size for the Wilcoxon signed rank test was 21 with an α error of 0.05 and 80% power.</groups_desc>
