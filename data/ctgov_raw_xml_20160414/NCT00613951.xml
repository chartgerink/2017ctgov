  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare two NN5401 (Soluble
      Insulin Analogue Combination [SIAC], insulin degludec/insulin aspart) formulations with each
      other and with biphasic insulin aspart 30, all in combination with metformin in insulin
      naive subjects with type 2 diabetes.

             months (no previous insulin treatment or previous short term insulin treatment
             maximum 14 days within the last 3 months)

          -  Treatment with one or two oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs): metformin, sulfonylurea,
             other insulin secretagogue (e.g. repaglinide, nateglinide), alpha-glucosidase
             inhibitors for at least 2 months at a stable maximally tolerated dose or at least
             half maximally allowed dose according to locally approved summary of product
             characteristics (SPC)

          -  HbA1c, 7.0-11.0 % (both inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI), 25.0-37.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metformin contraindication according to local practice

          -  Thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment within previous 3 months prior to Visit 1

          -  Any systemic treatment with products, which in the investigator's opinion could
             interfere with glucose or lipid metabolism (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) within 3
             months prior to randomisation

          -  Subject has a clinically significant, active (during the past 12 months) disease of
             the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurological, genitourinary, or haematological
             system (except for conditions associated with type 2 diabetes) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may confound the results of the trial or pose additional risk in
             administering trial product

        <description>Corresponds to rate of AEs per 100 patient years of exposure. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject’s daily activities.

Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
