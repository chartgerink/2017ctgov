  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. The current study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' HPV vaccine 580299 in HIV infected adult females living in
      the Republic of South Africa. The study is double blinded, randomized for HIV positive
      subjects and open for HIV negative subjects. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order
      to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

        <description>Laboratory parameters assessed were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine (CREA), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLA). For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated). Parameters presented in this table are haemoglobin (Hgb) and haematocrit (Hct).</description>

        <description>Laboratory parameters assessed were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine (CREA), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLA). For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated). Parameters presented in this table are ALAT, BAS, CREA, EOS, Hct, Hgb, LYM and MON.</description>

For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated).

For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated).

For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated).

        <description>Laboratory parameters assessed were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine (CREA), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLA).
For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated).
Parameters presented in this table are eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS) and creatinine (CREA).</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in Biochemical and Haematological Laboratory Parameters Assessed.</title>
        <description>Laboratory parameters assessed were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine (CREA), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLA).
For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated).
The parameter presented in this table is alanine aminotransferase (ALAT).</description>

        <description>Laboratory parameters assessed were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine (CREA), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLA). For each parameter and by pre-vaccination status, it was assessed whether the post-vaccination values of the parameter were above, below or in the normal range (missing values are also indicated). Parameters presented in this table are NEU, PLA, RBC and WBC.</description>
