  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival in participants with
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who have had disease progression following
      first-line therapy who undergo treatment with ramucirumab.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Are Progression-Free at 12 Weeks (Progression-Free Survival [PFS] Rate at 12 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 12-week PFS rate is the probability of participants who survived during the first 12 weeks in the study without disease progression. It was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for the main analysis of the 12-week PFS rate.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 30.3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The time from baseline to measured Progressive Disease (PD) as defined by RECIST v.1.1 [defined as &gt; 20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started (best response)], or death due to any cause, whichever is first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 38.0 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of CR or PR. According to RECIST v1.1, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter; CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels [if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal (ULN)]. The percentage of participants who achieved an objective response = (number of participants with CR or PR)/(number of participants assessed)*100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Stable Disease (SD) or a Confirmed CR or PR [Disease Control Rate (DCR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 12 Months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the ULN); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. The percentage of participants who achieved disease control = (number of participants with CR, PR, or SD)/(number of participants assessed)*100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Death from Any Cause (Up to 13 Months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The OS time is defined as the time from baseline to the date of death from any cause. If a participant is not known to have died on or before the date of data cut-off, OS data will be censored on the last date (on or before the cut-off date) the participant was known to be alive.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</title>
        <description>Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of CR or PR. According to RECIST v1.1, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter; CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels [if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal (ULN)]. The percentage of participants who achieved an objective response = (number of participants with CR or PR)/(number of participants assessed)*100.</description>
