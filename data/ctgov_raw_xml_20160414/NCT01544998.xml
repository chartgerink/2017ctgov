    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the effects of subcutaneous (under the skin) injection
      of human B-type natriuretic factor (BNP), Natrecor (nesiritide), a hormone produced by the
      heart, in combination with Tadalafil on:

        -  The pumping function of the heart

        -  Kidney function

        -  Hormonal function (levels of different hormones in your blood) in persons with lower
           pumping function of their heart.

    <textblock>
      In the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology classification of heart
      failure (HF), stage B is defined as patients with abnormal heart structure/function
      (systolic or diastolic dysfunction) without symptoms. This concept of preclinical HF is
      based on the fact that abnormal heart structure/function can be detected by complementary
      methods before the development of symptoms. Patients with those abnormalities may progress
      to heart failure and are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events. Preclinical systolic
      dysfunction (PSD) is the initial compensated phase of left ventricular systolic dysfunction
      without symptoms of HF. We have established that diastolic dysfunction is common in the
      general population being present in approximately 25% of the population over age 45, the
      majority of whom are asymptomatic i.e., preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PDD). Cyclic
      guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the second messenger of the natriuretic peptide system
      (NPS) and the nitric oxide system (NO) and plays an important role in the preservation of
      myocardial, vascular, and renal function. Hence, disruption of this signal transduction
      process may contribute to the development of cardiorenal dysfunction. Type V
      phosphodiesterase (PDEV) metabolizes cGMP and is abundant in the kidney, vasculature, and
      has been recently reported in the heart. We and others have demonstrated that renal PDEV is
      up-regulated in experimental HF and may lead to the attenuation of renal cGMP generation in
      response to both endogenous and exogenous BNP, thus serving as a mechanism for renal
      resistance to BNP. Furthermore, in experimental overt HF, 10 days of PDEV inhibition
      treatment resulted in reduction of left ventricular (LV) mass, increased LV fractional
      shortening and cardiac output but did not improve renal function. However, chronic PDEV
      inhibition did enhance the renal actions of exogenous BNP, specifically improving glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) and renal cGMP generation. PDEV inhibitors are FDA approved for
      erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
