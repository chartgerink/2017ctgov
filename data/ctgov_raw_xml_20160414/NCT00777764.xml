  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolled 30 healthy volunteers and 30 patients with atopic asthma, for a total of
      60 subjects. The study examined the tolerability of omalizumab and omalizumab excipients in
      two successive cohorts of subjects, healthy volunteers and patients with allergic asthma
      without prior exposure to omalizumab, according to a skin test protocol, consisting of a
      prick skin test and/or intradermal test.

    <description>Skin test procedures were skin prick test or intradermal test. The test started with the lowest concentration. If a positive skin reaction was observed, escalation to the next dilution was stopped. Subjects were observed for 20 minutes following each test; subjects were observed for 1 hour after the last intradermal test. Those with a positive response were observed for an additional 6 hours.
Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (mild, moderate or severe). Mild is itching or hives, for example. A severe event requires emergency medical treatment and can result in death.</description>

    <description>For skin prick, positive control (histamine 6 mg/mL) and negative control (saline) were used.
