  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) with insulin glargine in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes in Japan. Depending on pre-trial oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), subjects
      continued at the same dose and dosing frequency.
