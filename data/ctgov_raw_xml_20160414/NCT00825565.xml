  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe and effective allantoin 3% cream
      (Alwextin) is in improving the healing of recurrent skin lesions and reducing overall
      blistering in people with epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Allantoin 3% cream is applied
      topically to the entire body once daily.

      Potential subjects came to the for a screening visit. Eligible subjects had baseline
      assessments performed and were provided study medication, allantoin 3% cream. Subjects were
      instructed to apply the study medication to the entire body once daily and to keep daily
      record of study medication use. Subjects returned every 4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks for
      repeat assessments.

    <description>A common measure of the degree of involvement in skin disease is the Body Surface Area Index (BSAI). This measure is also commonly used in psoriasis studies. It is a global measure of disease &quot;spread&quot; with weighting factors.</description>

    <description>EB patients may have chronic wounds which are resistant to healing. Wound size may be very large and the probability of total wound closure with currently available treatments is unlikely. Reduction in the size of wounds may be clinically important to the rate of infection and pain. If a patient has a reduction in the size of wounds which are refractory to healing, this may be seen as a positive outcome. Wound size reduction is one of the primary assessments used to determine the efficacy of the study cream.
Wounds which had been present for at least several weeks prior to study entry were measured by using VISITRAK Digital, a Smith and Nephew wound tracing and measurement system that will calculate the length and width of the lesion (class 1 medical device; FDA listing designation E142354FDA). Only one target lesion per patient was used for the study assessment. At each subsequent study until the final visit, the target lesion was evaluated using VISITRAK Digital.</description>

    <description>The FDA has suggested that a global measure of severity might be the best way to assess EB from visit to visit. Assessment score may be influenced by other clinical observations in addition to the percentage of body affected by blistering and erosions. The assessment was intended to be a &quot;global impression.&quot;
This scale produced a score with the following correlations:
0 = clear (no blistering/erosions) 1-2 = almost clear (infrequent blistering and erosions) 3-4 = mild disease (up to 15% of body affected) 5-6 = moderate disease (between 16-25% of body affected) 7-8 = severe disease (between 26-50% of body affected) 9-10 = very severe disease (greater than 50% of body affected)</description>

    <description>In addition to skin blistering and erosions, people with EB experience other symptoms, such as erythema on unblistered skin, wound oozing, weeping, and crusting. These symptoms may vary with area of the body evaluated.
This scale evaluates the following signs: Blistering and erosions, oozing/weeping/crusting, pruritis, erythema on unblistered surrounding skin, pain, milia Each of these signs will be scored in 4 body areas: head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs The following scale is used:0 = clear 1 = almost clear 2 = mild 3 = moderate 4 = severe</description>

        <title>Physician Global Assessment of Severity (PGAS)</title>
        <description>The FDA has suggested that a global measure of severity might be the best way to assess EB from visit to visit. Assessment score may be influenced by other clinical observations in addition to the percentage of body affected by blistering and erosions. The assessment was intended to be a &quot;global impression.&quot;
This scale produced a score with the following correlations:
0 = clear (no blistering/erosions) 1-2 = almost clear (infrequent blistering and erosions) 3-4 = mild disease (up to 15% of body affected) 5-6 = moderate disease (between 16-25% of body affected) 7-8 = severe disease (between 26-50% of body affected) 9-10 = very severe disease (greater than 50% of body affected)</description>

        <title>Physician Assessment of Individual Signs</title>
        <description>In addition to skin blistering and erosions, people with EB experience other symptoms, such as erythema on unblistered skin, wound oozing, weeping, and crusting. These symptoms may vary with area of the body evaluated.
This scale evaluates the following signs: Blistering and erosions, oozing/weeping/crusting, pruritis, erythema on unblistered surrounding skin, pain, milia Each of these signs will be scored in 4 body areas: head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs The following scale is used:0 = clear 1 = almost clear 2 = mild 3 = moderate 4 = severe</description>

      <desc>AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure. SAE meets any of these criteria: causes death, hospitalization, disability, or birth defect, is life-threatening, is an important medical event that may require intervention to prevent these outcomes.</desc>

          <description>This is an open-label study in which all enrolled subjects were assigned to receive the study medication, allantoin 3% cream. Subjects were required to have a diagnosis of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). The diagnosis of EB was based on diagnostic immunomapping, electron microscopy, or the principal investigator's judgment based on clear clinical characteristics. Subjects were instructed to apply allantoin 3% cream once daily to the entire body.</description>
