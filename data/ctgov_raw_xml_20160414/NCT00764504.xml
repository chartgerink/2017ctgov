    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Encore
      Reverse Shoulder Prosthesis (RSP). The clinical results of the RSP will be compared to
      clinical results published in literature for rotator cuff arthropathy and salvage
      procedures.

    <description>The patient self-report section of the ASES is a condition specific scale which is intended to measure functional limitations and pain of the shoulder. On a scale of 0 to 100, the use of their shoulder is measured with 0 = no use and 100 = full use. The assessment is done in two sections. One Pain (measured by the Visual Analog Pain Scale) and the second is a list of 10 questions referred to as the Activities of Daily Living. The results are calculated with the following equation:
[(10 - Visual analog scale pain score) x 5] + [(5/3) x Cumulative ADL score]</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Irreparable rotator cuff or failed hemi or total shoulder arthroplasty with
             irreparable rotator cuff

          -  Evidence of upward displacement of the humeral head with respect to the glenoid

          -  Loss of glenohumeral joint space

          -  Functional deltoid muscle

          -  Patient is likely to be available for evaluation for the duration of the study

          -  Visual Analog Pain Scale 5 or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non functional deltoid muscle

          -  Active sepsis

          -  Excessive glenoid bone loss

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Neurological abnormalities, which could hinder patient's ability or willingness to
             follow study procedures. For example, any that may restrict physical activities such
             as Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, or previous stroke, which affects upper
             extremity.

          -  Mental conditions that may interfere with ability to give an informed consent or
             willingness to fulfill the study requirements (i.e., severe mental retardation such
             that the patient cannot understand the informed consent process, global dementia,
             prior strokes that interfere with the patient's cognitive abilities, senile dementia,
             and Alzheimer's Disease.

          -  Prisoners

          -  Conditions that place excessive demand on the implant (i.e. Charcot's joints, muscle
             deficiencies, refusal to modify postoperative physical activities, skeletal
             immaturity).

          -  Known metal allergy (i.e., jewelry).

          -  Visual Analog Pain Scale &lt;5.

        <description>The patient self-report section of the ASES is a condition specific scale which is intended to measure functional limitations and pain of the shoulder. On a scale of 0 to 100, the use of their shoulder is measured with 0 = no use and 100 = full use. The assessment is done in two sections. One Pain (measured by the Visual Analog Pain Scale) and the second is a list of 10 questions referred to as the Activities of Daily Living. The results are calculated with the following equation:
