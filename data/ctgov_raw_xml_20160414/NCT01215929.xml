  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use is very common in the US and is associated with serious medical and
      psychiatric problems. There has also been a significant increase in the number of patients
      entering treatment for methamphetamine dependence, however, no pharmacologic treatment has
      been identified as effective in treating methamphetamine addiction. Given that withdrawal
      from methamphetamine is thought to contribute to relapse to methamphetamine use during early
      treatment, it is important to examine potential pharmacologic agents for alleviating
      withdrawal. Thus, this study is designed to study methamphetamine withdrawal in humans. To
      this end, 30 methamphetamine dependent participants (ages 18-65 years) will be entered into
      a 4-week residential study. Urine samples will be obtained at baseline to ensure recent
      methamphetamine use. Intake assessments will include cognitive testing, standardized
      assessment of depression and anxiety, profile of mood states, methamphetamine selective
      severity assessment, methamphetamine withdrawal assessment, sleep quality and quantity, a
      pre-attentional measure and attentional measure. Upon admission to the residential facility,
      all study participants will be started on (20-30mg) long acting amphetamine/d-amphetamine
      and stabilized over the first 5 days. After stabilization participants will be randomized
      based on sex, amphetamine withdrawal questionnaire score, and methamphetamine selective
      severity assessment score to either continued treatment with amphetamine/d-amphetamine or
      placebo for 2 weeks. All subjects will then be placed on placebo for the last 7 days. The
      investigators hypothesis is that stopping amphetamine administration in methamphetamine
      dependent individuals will negatively impact mood, sleep and cognitive function in a
      time-limited fashion that may differ depending upon the measure and that attentional, but
      not pre-attentional, measures will be adversely affected in those receiving placebo compared
      to those maintained on amphetamine.

    <description>Total score on the Methamphetamine Withdrawal Assessment scale (MAWA) based on DSMIV criteria for amphetamine withdrawal. This questionnaire is comprised of 13 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score indicating no methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms is 0 and the maximum score is 4 indicating that a patient has the most severe withdrawal symptom related to that question. The subscales are the 13 questions and the total score is the sum of all the scores for the 13 items on the scale. The range minium and better outcome is a lower score. The range is from 0-52. The worse outcome is reflected in a higher score.</description>

            <title>Measure of Methamphetamine Withdrawal</title>
            <description>Total score on the Methamphetamine Withdrawal Assessment scale (MAWA) based on DSMIV criteria for amphetamine withdrawal. This questionnaire is comprised of 13 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score indicating no methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms is 0 and the maximum score is 4 indicating that a patient has the most severe withdrawal symptom related to that question. The subscales are the 13 questions and the total score is the sum of all the scores for the 13 items on the scale. The range minium and better outcome is a lower score. The range is from 0-52. The worse outcome is reflected in a higher score.</description>
