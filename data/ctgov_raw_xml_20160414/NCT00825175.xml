  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines the effect of orthotic use in combination with treadmill training on
      the development of gross motor skills and walking onset in infants with Down syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if orthotic use impacts the development of walking
      and upright play skills over and above the impact that treadmill training alone has. Infants
      with Down syndrome who can pull to stand but not walk will be recruited and assigned to a
      group that receives treadmill training and orthoses or just treadmill training. The infants
      are followed monthly until they have one month of walking experience. During the monthly
      visits, the infants' gross motor development is tested and their upright play behavior is
      observed. At the end of the study each infants gait is evaluated. We believe that the
      orthoses will lead to a decreased age at walking onset, an improvement in gait patterns, and
      an improvement in upright play ability.
