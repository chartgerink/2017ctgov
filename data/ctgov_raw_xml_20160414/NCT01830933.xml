  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research combines the scientific advances in breast cancer research with health
      information technology (IT) to design a personalized intervention that assesses breast
      cancer risk for women, disseminates important breast health information, and facilitates
      discussion of breast cancer risk reduction practices. Our goal is to implement a tablet-PC
      (personal computer) based breast cancer risk education (BreastCare) intervention in the
      primary care setting that estimates a woman's individual risk for breast cancer and provides
      her and her physician with personalized breast cancer risk information and recommendations
      for action.

    <description>Intervention Clinic Patients: The RA will welcome the patient upon arrival at the clinic and again explain study procedures and field any questions. The RA will have the patient sign the HIPAA authorization form and then demonstrate how to enter information and answer questions on the tablet-PC and the patient will indicate their consent electronically before beginning the assessment.
Intervention Patient Report. Once the patient completes the BreastCare Computer survey, the program will immediately generate a personal feedback report containing information about her risk factors and recommendations to reduce her risk. This report will be printed and given to the patietns before she meets with her doctor.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized into the intervention or comparison groups at the time of recruitment. Block-randomization will be used to assign patients to intervention or comparison groups.
Comparison Clinic Patients. Contact and baseline interview procedures will be the same for patients from the comparison clinics, however there will be no computer assessment at the time of their clinic visit. An RA will meet the patient 10 minutes prior to her appointment time to obtain written HIPAA authorization.</description>

    <description>Physician Report. At the time of an individual participant's visit to her primary care physician and her completion of the assessment tool, her physician will receive a physician report. The physician report is designed to facilitate communication about breast cancer risk during the primary care visit and to provide tailored risk reduction recommendations.</description>
