      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a trans-endoscopic
      capsule placement Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural ingestion of a wireless capsule endoscope (e.g. PillCam™ SB) is contraindicated in
      subjects with oropharyngeal or mechanical dysphagia, gastroparesis and known or suspected
      anatomical abnormalities. In addition, ingestion of a wireless capsule endoscope may be
      challenging in the pediatric population. The PillCam® Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery
      System is intended to provide physicians with the capability to place capsules in the
      proximal duodenum using the accessory channel of a standard endoscope.

      The PillCam™ SB capsule to be used in this study was cleared by the FDA in August 2001 for
      small bowel evaluation. It has been ingested to date by more than 1,000,000 people worldwide
      and is well accepted by subjects and physicians as well as the professional societies.

      Further details of the PillCam®Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System can be found in the
      device description section.

      This study is designed to evaluate the performance and safety of the Capsule Endoscopy
      Delivery System in subjects indicated to undergo a standard Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
      endoscopy

    <description>The PillCam® Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System is comprised of three parts: a catheter, a syringe and the capsule holder. The catheter is passed through the accessory channel of a standard endoscope and the capsule holder is snapped on to the distal end of the device. The endoscope is used to guide the Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System to the proximal duodenum. The capsule is then released pneumatically, using an air-filled syringe attached to the proximal end of the catheter.
Once the capsule is deployed, the endoscope is withdrawn and the capsule holder is cut off at the distal part of the device with scissors. The catheter is then retracted and discarded.
The PillCam® Express Capsule Endoscopy Delivery System is single-use, disposable and latex-free.</description>
