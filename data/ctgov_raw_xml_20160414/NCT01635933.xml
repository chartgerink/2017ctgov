    <description>Participants were asked to compare the study lenses to their habitual lenses using a 5-point scale: strongly prefer study lenses, somewhat prefer study lenses, no preference, somewhat prefer habitual lenses, and strongly prefer habitual lenses, where 'study lenses' refer to either test or control depending on the treatment group. Proportion of subjects preferring study lens is reported as the percentage of participants who strongly or somewhat preferred the study lens.</description>

          -  Able to achieve visual acuity of at least 20/30 (Snellen) in each eye at distance
             with contact lenses and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 20/25 in each eye.

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 diopters (within the previous year) in
             each eye.

          -  Successful wear of FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes
             (in the protocol-specified colors) during the past three months for a minimum of 5
             days per week and 8 hours per day.

          -  History of at least 5 days of successful use with both lenses (minimum of 8
             hours/day) of one of the protocol-specified lens care solutions/multi-purpose
             solutions (MPS).

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the

             of this study.

          -  Wears habitual lenses in an extended wear modality (sleeping in lenses overnight /
             not removing lenses on a daily basis).

          -  Monovision, monocular (only one eye with functional vision) or fit with only one
             lens.

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the test articles.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter or prescribed topical ocular medications within the
             previous 7 days (excluding rewetting drops).

          -  Moderate or severe corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining,
             injection, tarsal abnormalities, &quot;other&quot; complications; and any corneal infiltrates.

          -  Current or history of ocular infection, severe inflammation, or disease within
             previous 6 months.

          -  Any systemic disease (including allergies, respiratory infections or colds) that may
             affect the eye or be exacerbated by use of contact lenses or contact lens solutions.

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within previous 30 days.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
