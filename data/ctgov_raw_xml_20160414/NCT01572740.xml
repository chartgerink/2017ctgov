  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The purpose of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of liraglutide in combination with insulin therapy compared to insulin alone in
      Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects will remain on their pre-trial
      insulin therapy.
