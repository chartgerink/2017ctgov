    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate solution-related corneal staining with
      an investigational multi-purpose disinfecting solution (MPDS) in hydrogel and silicone
      hydrogel contact lens wearers.

    <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator using fluorescein dye, a yellow filter, and a slit lamp. Corneal staining was graded on a continuous scale of 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region) in 1% increments for 5 corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior). Solution-related corneal staining was defined as ≥20% corneal staining area in at least 3 corneal regions of both eyes.</description>

    <description>Lens comfort was assessed by the participant on a 5-point Likert scale prior to any examination.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Wear contact lenses a minimum of 8 hours per day for at least 7-10 days prior to
             Visit 1 (screening visit).

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with contact
             lenses at Visit 1.

          -  Must discontinue contact lens wear for at least two consecutive days before Visit 2
             (baseline visit).

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition (systemic or ophthalmic) that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, preclude safe administration of test article or safe participation in
             the study.

          -  Known sensitivity or intolerance to any protocol-specified contact lens solutions,
             eye drops, or products containing similar ingredients (e.g., generic products).

          -  Monocular vision (only one eye with functional vision) or fit with only one contact
             lens.

          -  Use of topical ocular over-the-counter or prescribed topical ocular medication, with
             the exception of rewetting drops, within 7 days prior to screening visit.

          -  Current or history of ocular infection, inflammation, disease, structural abnormality
             or conditions within the last 6 months that could affect study participation or may
             preclude safe administration of the investigational lens care solution, in the
             opinion of the investigator.

          -  Any corneal surgery, cataract surgery, intraocular lens implants or glaucoma
             filtering surgery within the last 12 months.

          -  Any slit-lamp finding score of 1 (or rated 3 or 4 for limbal and bulbar conjunctival
             injection) at screening or baseline visits.

          -  Corneal staining area assessment ≥ 20% in any corneal region in either eye at
             baseline visit.

          -  Corneal staining graded as 2 (macropunctate) or greater in any corneal region in
             either eye at baseline visit.

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within 30 days of baseline visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
