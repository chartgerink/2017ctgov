  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and/or bad) this new cancer
      vaccine has on the patient and their cancer, whether it is safe and whether it can help get
      rid of their cancer (malignant melanoma). We want to check how the patient's immune system
      reacts, both before and after the vaccine treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine will be made by mixing two kinds of cells: 1) some of the patient's own
      malignant melanoma cells which were removed by surgery and then processed in the Cell
      Therapy Laboratory, and 2) experimental &quot;bystander&quot; cells. All the cells in the vaccine will
      be treated with high-dose X-rays to make sure that none of them grow and cause more cancer.
      The bystander cells, called &quot;GM.CD40L&quot;, are human cells that have been genetically changed.
      The original cells, called K562, had the genes for human GM-CSF and CD40L inserted into
      them. These changes are designed to help boost the patient's immune system to better fight
      the cancer in their body.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
