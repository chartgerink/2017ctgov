  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of bimatoprost solution on scalp hair
      growth. Bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution is currently approved by the FDA for treatment
      of glaucoma (Lumigan™) and for thickening of thin eyelashes (Latisse™). Bimatoprost 0.03% is
      not approved for the treatment of scalp hair loss and its use in this study is considered
      investigational which means it is still being tested in research studies.

      Thirty-three subjects were consented and screened, 9 entered and 9 completed the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 17; and week 17 to week 34</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Vellus hairs are fine hairs that generally do not grow beyond 1 cm and do not contribute to overall hair density. For the most part, they have a diameter of &lt;40 um. They are increased in number in male pattern baldness</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Hair Diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 17; Week 17 to week 34</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The percent change in hair diameter is a recent addition to the methods of assessing efficacy of hair growth promoters. It is a measure of hair mass and does not separate out the effect on terminal and vellus hairs but rather combines the effect on both. Since it is only terminal hairs that contributes to normal hair density, this measure does not add anything to the measures of total, terminal and vellus hair counts in terms of overall effect on hair growth and is therefore not analyzed or reported here.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Hair Diameter</title>
        <description>The percent change in hair diameter is a recent addition to the methods of assessing efficacy of hair growth promoters. It is a measure of hair mass and does not separate out the effect on terminal and vellus hairs but rather combines the effect on both. Since it is only terminal hairs that contributes to normal hair density, this measure does not add anything to the measures of total, terminal and vellus hair counts in terms of overall effect on hair growth and is therefore not analyzed or reported here.</description>
