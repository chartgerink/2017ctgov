    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Relation to study drug was assessed by the Investigator as either suspected or not suspected. Counts represent the suspected relationship. Severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0): 1= Mild 2= Moderate 3= Severe 4= Life-threatening and 5= Death related to AE. Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring on or after the first treatment of the study medication and within 28 days after the last dose.</description>

            <title>Myeloma Response Rate Based on European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Criteria</title>
            <description>Myeloma response was defined as a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)
CR is defined as:
Absence of original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by immunofixation maintained at least 42 days.
&lt;5% plasma cell in bone marrow aspirate and on bone marrow biopsy, if performed.
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions.
Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas.
PR requires all of the following:
≥ 50% reduction in level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, maintained at least 42 days.
Reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain extraction by ≥ 90% or to &lt; 200 mg, maintained at least 42 days.
For patients with non-secretory myeloma, ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate and on biopsy, if performed, for at least 42 days.
≥ 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas.
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions.</description>
