  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety of &amp; immune response to a single dose of
      GSK Biologicals' cell-culture based influenza vaccine 138842A with that of a US licensed,
      egg-based trivalent influenza vaccine [Fluarix] in healthy adults.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (MALAY.)</description>

    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 21</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>GMFR was defined as the geometric mean of the ratio of the post-vaccination inverse HI titer to the Day 0 inverse HI titer. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (MALAY.)</description>
