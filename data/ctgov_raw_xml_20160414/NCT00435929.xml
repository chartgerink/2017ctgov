  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the effect of moderate liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      of saquinavir and ritonavir at steady state following administration of saquinavir/ritonavir
      1000mg/100mg po bid in HIV patients. Saquinavir/ritonavir will be administered concomitantly
      with 2 to 3 active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The study will compare a
      group of HIV patients without known liver disease and a group with moderate liver disease.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100
      individuals.

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time of Administration to 12 Hours After Dosing (AUC 0-12h) of Saquinavir (SQV) and Ritonavir (RTV)</title>
        <description>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption. The pharmacokinetic profile for following 14 days of administration with SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg BID included determining the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours after dosing (AUC (0-12h) of SQV and RTV The AUC (0-12hours) was analyzed for SQV and RTV by non-compartmental methods, using WinNonlin.</description>
