    <measure>Least Squares Mean Difference in Binocular UCVA at 1 Month Post-Treatment and Pre-Treatment Binocular BCVA</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Visual acuity (VA) with corrective devices (BCVA) was assessed binocularly (both eyes together) pre-treatment and subtracted from VA without spectacles or other visual corrective devices (UCVA) assessed binocularly at 1 month post-treatment. VA was measured at a distance of 4 meters and reported in logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), with 0.00 logMAR corresponding to 20/20 Snellen. A negative value indicates an improvement in VA from pre-treatment to Month 1.</description>

    <description>The expected flap thickness as determined pre-operatively was subtracted from the achieved flap thickness as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) (ie, an imaging method using light to capture three-dimensional images).

    <description>As recorded by the subject on the RSVP questionnaire, where 0 is &quot;Not applicable&quot;, 1 is &quot;No difficulty at all&quot;, 2 is &quot;A little difficulty&quot;, 3 is &quot;Moderate difficulty&quot;, 4 is &quot;Severe difficulty&quot; and 5 is &quot;So much difficulty that I did not do the activity with this alternative&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Mean Contrast Sensitivity (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 1 Postoperative, Month 1 Postoperative, Month 3 Postoperative, Month 6 Postoperative</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity (ie, the ability to detect slight changes in luminance before they become indistinguishable) was assessed binocularly with distance manifest correction in place and uncorrected. Contrast sensitivity was assessed at spatial frequencies of 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (cpd), where 3.0 cpd = A, 6.0 cpd = B, 12.0 cpd = C, and 18.0 cpd = D. Raw scores were log transformed. A higher numeric value represents better contrast sensitivity.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Wavefront aberrations (optical imperfections of the eye that prevent light from focusing perfectly on the retina, resulting in defects in the visual image) were measured using a commercially available system. Higher order aberrations (i.e., spherical aberrations, coma, and trifoil) are defined as optical imperfections which cannot be corrected by any reliable means of present technology.</description>

            <title>Mean Difference Between Achieved and Target Corneal Flap Thickness as Assessed by OCT</title>
            <description>The expected flap thickness as determined pre-operatively was subtracted from the achieved flap thickness as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) (ie, an imaging method using light to capture three-dimensional images). A positive number represents a postoperative flap thickness that is thicker than the expected flap thickness and vice versa for a negative number.</description>

        <title>Mean Contrast Sensitivity (CS)</title>
        <description>Contrast sensitivity (ie, the ability to detect slight changes in luminance before they become indistinguishable) was assessed binocularly with distance manifest correction in place and uncorrected. Contrast sensitivity was assessed at spatial frequencies of 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (cpd), where 3.0 cpd = A, 6.0 cpd = B, 12.0 cpd = C, and 18.0 cpd = D. Raw scores were log transformed. A higher numeric value represents better contrast sensitivity.</description>

        <description>Wavefront aberrations (optical imperfections of the eye that prevent light from focusing perfectly on the retina, resulting in defects in the visual image) were measured using a commercially available system. Higher order aberrations (i.e., spherical aberrations, coma, and trifoil) are defined as optical imperfections which cannot be corrected by any reliable means of present technology.</description>

            <title>Wavefront Aberrometry</title>
            <description>Wavefront aberrations (optical imperfections of the eye that prevent light from focusing perfectly on the retina, resulting in defects in the visual image) were measured using a commercially available system. Higher order aberrations (i.e., spherical aberrations, coma, and trifoil) are defined as optical imperfections which cannot be corrected by any reliable means of present technology.</description>
