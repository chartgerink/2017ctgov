      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that untrained subjects who have diabetes can
      operate the Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) and obtain valid glucose
      results.

    <description>Untrained subjects with diabetes who self-tested fingerstick blood used the Ninja 3 PLUS investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). BGMS results were compared with capillary plasma BG results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method - YSI Life Sciences (YSI) Analyzer.
