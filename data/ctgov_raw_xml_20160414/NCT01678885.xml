  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test different methods of measuring energy balance,
      including food intake and energy expenditure. Another purpose of this study is to see if
      energy expenditure predicts weight and change after a weight loss diet.

      The study will take place over a period of one year. Participants will spend 3 weeks
      completing Phase I, and eight weeks completing Phase II (the weight loss phase of the
      study). Then, participants will return to the center at months 6 and 12 for a follow-up
      visit. During these visits, body weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be recorded, and
      questionnaires about eating attitudes and habits will be collected and assessed.

    <description>A new method of digital photography of foods to measure the energy intake (EI) and macronutrient intake of free-living humans was tested. Digital photography (RFPM) EI was tested against measured food provisions during an in-feeding period and against EI measured with doubly labeled water (DLW) during free-living conditions. EI measured by directly weighing food provisions in the clinic over two days and measuring food intake during free-living conditions over one week with the DLW.</description>

    <description>The secondary aim was to test if posture allocation (the amount of time spent engaging in certain behaviors e.g., sitting, walking, running, changing positions and the energy burned during these activities) predicts weight change over one year following a period of weight loss</description>

    <description>During the first week of the doubly labeled water (DLW) period, participants in group 1 will use digital photography of foods. During the second week of the DLW phase, participants in this group will wear the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) monitor and an accelerometer. Participants in group 2 will wear the IDEEA monitor and accelerometer in the first week of the DLW period and digital photography of foods during the second week. Participants who complete the first two weeks and have a BMI over 25kg/m2 will receive a partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. This diet plan is a 1000-1150 kcal/day diet that participants will complete in a free-living environment. All participants will return to follow-up at six and twelve months after they completed the LCD. Anthropometric and questionnaire data will be collected.</description>

    <description>The digital photography of foods method was developed to unobtrusively measure energy intake in naturalistic settings (e.g., cafeterias). Participants will be provided with cell-phones with digital cameras and cellular network capability. Participants were trained to take pictures of their food selection and plate waste and to send these pictures to the researchers over the cellular network. The participant will collect data in free-living conditions and these data will be collected in near real time.</description>

    <description>Doubly labeled water, considered the gold standard for measuring energy intake in humans, was used to measure total daily energy expenditure during free-living conditions. DLW is used to obtain an accurate measure of total daily energy expenditure, which is equal to energy intake during energy balance.</description>

            <description>A new method of digital photography of foods to measure the energy intake (EI) and macronutrient intake of free-living humans was tested. Digital photography (RFPM) EI was tested against measured food provisions during an in-feeding period and against EI measured with doubly labeled water (DLW) during free-living conditions. EI measured by directly weighing food provisions in the clinic over two days and measuring food intake during free-living conditions over one week with the DLW.</description>

            <description>Participants who complete Phase I of the study received a partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. This diet plan was a 1000-1150 kcal/day diet composed of Health One shakes and prepackaged portion controlled foods or home-cooked meals that participants completed in a free-living environment. Participants returned to follow-up at six and twelve months after they completed the LCD. During these assessments, anthropometric and questionnaire data was collected.</description>
