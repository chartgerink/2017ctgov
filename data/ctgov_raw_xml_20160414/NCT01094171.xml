    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were Drowsiness, Irritability, Loss of appetite and Fever [Axillary temperature greater than or equal to (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurrence of any specified solicited general symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = oral temperature ≥ 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C).

            <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were Drowsiness, Irritability, Loss of appetite and Fever [Axillary temperature greater than or equal to (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurrence of any specified solicited general symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = oral temperature ≥ 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature &gt; 39.0°C.</description>
