  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be assessing the effect of Aged Garlic Extract on the coronary
      arteries. The investigators will enroll patients in a double blind study, where half the
      patients will receive placebo, and have the patients undergo a series of tests of plaque (CT
      scan of the heart, carotid ultrasound) and follow the patients on the drug or placebo and
      then repeat the tests and blood work at the end of one year. The investigators will assess
      if being on aged garlic extract adds any benefit to plaque in the coronary or neck arteries.
      The investigators will also assess the effect of aged garlic extract on markers of
      inflammation. Patients will receive free drug, free testing and be compensated, and learn
      more about their heart and neck arteries. if successful, more patients can use this drug to
      benefit their health. The harms include the radiation from the CT scan and the medication,
      which has mild side effects.

    <description>we measured low attenuation plaque at baseline (in volume) and then again at 1 year. In a double-blinded analysis, there was reduction in low attenuation plaque volume (percent of change from baseline, defined as [followup-baseline]/baseline x100%.
Baseline was time zero, followup CT scan was 1 year. For this measure (Low attenuation plaque), we had 28 interpretable baseline and follow up images to use in placebo(sugar pill), for Aged garlic extract, we had 27 interpretable paired data sets (both baseline and follow up had to be interpretable to use the measure).</description>
