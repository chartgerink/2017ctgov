  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety of a bioCSL split virion, inactivated Trivalent
      Influenza Virus vaccine containing the 2014/2015 Northern Hemisphere strains of vaccine in
      children aged 5 years to less than 9 years. Comparison will be made to a licensed
      Quadrivalent Influenza Virus vaccine that complies with the FDA recommendations for the
      2014/2015 influenza season in the US.
