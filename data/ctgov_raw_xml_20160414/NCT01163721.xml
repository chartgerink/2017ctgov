  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolled participants with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) despite non-insulin antidiabetic therapy in addition to diet and exercise, and would
      have benefited from additional control of blood glucose levels. The study assessed the
      metabolic effects of ranolazine, including its effect in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin
      A1c (HbA1c), and lowering glucose while fasting, and following a meal (postprandial).

      Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ranolazine or placebo, and were
      stratified by HbA1c ≤ 7.5% or &gt; 7.5%. Enrollment was to include no more than two-thirds of
      participants with baseline HbA1c ≤ 7.5%. Other than glucose values, efficacy endpoint
      results remained blinded during the study; for safety purposes, the investigator was to be
      alerted of severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

      Participants were instructed to maintain logs of their physical activity/exercise (Subject
      Activity Assessment) and study drug dosing (Dosing Log).

    <description>HbA1c is a blood test to measure blood sugar control over the prior 3-month period. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used: the last observed post-baseline measurements prior to Week 12 carried forward for participants with no available Week 12 values. Participants were summarized according to the actual treatment received regardless of the allocated treatment.</description>

    <description>2-hour postprandial serum glucose was defined as the average of serum glucose measurement at 120 minutes and 125 minutes following a standardized meal. The LOCF method was used.
