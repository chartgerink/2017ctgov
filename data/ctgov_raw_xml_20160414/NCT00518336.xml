  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. This Phase IIb study is designed to evaluate the the long-term efficacy,
      safety and immunogenicity of the 580299 HPV vaccine (CervarixTM) in a Brazilian cohort of
      women vaccinated in the phase IIb, blinded, primary study 580299/001 (NCT00689741) and
      having participated in follow-up study 580299/007 (NCT00120848). Only subjects who
      participated in the primary &amp; follow-up study will be enrolled in this long-term follow-up
      study. Subjects were aged 15-25 years at the time of entry into the primary study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

      In this extension study, women who were vaccinated in the primary study, and participated in
      the follow-up study, will be followed with visits every 6 months.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Persistent Infection (6-month Definition) With Any Oncogenic HPV Types</title>
        <description>Oncogenic HPV types included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Persistent cervical HPV infection (6-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at 2 consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 5 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

            <description>Oncogenic HPV types included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Persistent cervical HPV infection (12-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at all consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 10 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

            <description>CIN2+ was defined as CIN grades 2 and 3, AIS and invasive cervical cancer.
Oncogenic HPV types assessed included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. and were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at Month 6 in the primary study.</description>

            <description>Oncogenic HPV types included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Persistent cervical HPV infection (6-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at 2 consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 5 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Persistent Infection (6-month Definition) With Any Oncogenic HPV Type</title>

Persistent cervical HPV infection (6-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at 2 consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 5 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

            <title>Number of Subjects With Persistent Infection (12-month Definition) With Any Oncogenic HPV Type</title>
            <description>Oncogenic HPV types included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Persistent cervical HPV infection (12-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at all consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 10 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>
