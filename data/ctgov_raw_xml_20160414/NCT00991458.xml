    <measure>Time to Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Time to cure is defined as the number of days after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery that the patient has corneal sensitivity (the capability of the cornea to respond to stimulation) ≥ 50 millimeters in all 9 regions of both eyes after LASIK surgery. A patient is considered cured at the first of 2 consecutive visits meeting these criteria. The Inter-Quartile Range presented is actually the 25th Quantile and the 75th Quantile obtained from the Kaplan-Meier Model.</description>

    <measure>Time to Worst Outcome Post-LASIK Surgery in Tear Film Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 3 to 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The time to the worst outcome post-LASIK surgery in tear film stability is assessed using the Ocular Scatter Index (OSI). The OSI is calculated by an instrument which takes images of the eye over time. OSI values ≥3.0 indicate lower tear film quality resulting in a loss of visual acuity. The worst outcome post-LASIK surgery is defined as the shortest time to OSI ≥3 across both eyes and post-LASIK surgery months 3 to 6.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Cumulative Poor Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 4, Month 5, Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cumulative Poor Vision is determined binocularly per patient (using both eyes at the same time) from the Poor Vision question on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. Severity of poor vision is graded on a 5-point scale (0 = none of the time, 1 = some of the time, 2 = half of the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = all of the time). Cumulative poor vision is defined as at least one poor vision score ≥ 1 beginning at Month 3 post-LASIK.</description>

    <measure>Worst Outcome Post-LASIK Surgery in Reading Speed Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 3 to 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Reading speed is determined using the MNREAD™ Reading Card. The MNREAD™ reading card is designed to simulate a normal every day reading scenario using binocular vision (both eyes at the same time). The MNREAD™ Reading speed is calculated as (60) X [Number of words on card - (reading errors)]/ (number of seconds until the card is read). The worst outcome is defined as the smallest number of words per minute across post-LASIK surgery months 3 to 6.</description>

            <title>Time to Worst Outcome Post-LASIK Surgery in Tear Film Assessment</title>
            <description>The time to the worst outcome post-LASIK surgery in tear film stability is assessed using the Ocular Scatter Index (OSI). The OSI is calculated by an instrument which takes images of the eye over time. OSI values ≥3.0 indicate lower tear film quality resulting in a loss of visual acuity. The worst outcome post-LASIK surgery is defined as the shortest time to OSI ≥3 across both eyes and post-LASIK surgery months 3 to 6.</description>

Severity of poor vision is graded on a 5-point scale (0 = none of the time, 1 = some of the time, 2 = half of the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = all of the time). Cumulative poor vision is defined as at least one poor vision score ≥ 1 beginning at Month 3 post-LASIK.</description>

        <description>Reading speed is determined using the MNREAD™ Reading Card. The MNREAD™ reading card is designed to simulate a normal every day reading scenario using binocular vision (both eyes at the same time). The MNREAD™ Reading speed is calculated as (60) X [Number of words on card - (reading errors)]/ (number of seconds until the card is read). The worst outcome is defined as the smallest number of words per minute across post-LASIK surgery months 3 to 6.</description>
