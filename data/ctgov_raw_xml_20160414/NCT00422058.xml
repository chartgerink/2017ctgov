  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The purpose of the 20-week trial is to investigate the
      efficacy of liraglutide to induce body weight loss and the purpose of the extension is to
      evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of liraglutide.

      Trial has the following trial periods: A 20-week randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, six-armed parallel-group, multi-centre, multinational trial with an open
      label orlistat comparator arm followed by an 84 week extension period.
