      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of milnacipran for the treatment of pain
      in rheumatoid arthritis in older adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week open-label trial of milnacipran for the treatment of pain in rheumatoid
      arthritis in older adults. The investigators are interested in the relationship of chronic
      pain to inflammation, resilience, fatigue, and physical and mental functioning. The
      investigators anticipate that effective pain reduction will result in improved fatigue,
      resilience, physical and mental functioning and reduced levels of inflammation. The
      investigators are seeking to examine this directly in 30 older adults (55 years of age or
      older) with rheumatoid arthritis who will be using milnacipran for treatment of pain in the
      absence of clinical major depression. This proposed trial will serve as a pilot study to
      estimate the effect of the drug on pain and functional outcomes, as well as aid in
      dose-finding in this population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Diagnosis. RA subjects will be evaluated by a board certified
        rheumatologist using revised criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology
        (ACR). This requires at least four of the following seven criteria: 1) morning joint
        stiffness; 2) arthritis in 3 or more joint areas; 3) arthritis of hand joints; 4)
        symmetric arthritis; 5) rheumatoid nodules; 6) presence of serum rheumatoid factor and 7)
        changes on posteroanterior hand and wrist radiographs. In addition, criteria 1-4 must be
        present for at least four weeks. Individuals diagnosed with juvenile RA will be excluded.

        Inclusion Criteria: Medication Use for RA patients. RA subjects taking disease modifying
        anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) must be on a stable regime for one month before study and
        stable throughout study. RA subjects using DMARDs will be categorized as follows: 1) no
        DMARDs; 2) DMARD monotherapy with sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, minocycline, or
        azothioprine, 3) DMARD monotherapy with methotrexate or leflunomide, 4) biologic therapy
        with or without concomitant DMARDs.

        Exclusion Criteria: Medical conditions. Subjects will not be eligible for the study based
        on the following criteria: (1) presence of acute or uncontrolled co-morbid medical
        conditions not limited to but including cardiovascular (e.g., history of acute coronary
        event, stroke, uncontrolled HTN) and neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease), as
        well as pain disorders; (2) presence of co-morbid inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's
        disease and ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune disorders; (3) presence of an
        uncontrolled medical condition that is deemed by the investigators to interfere with the
        proposed study procedures, or put the study participant at undue risk; (4) presence of
        chronic infections (e.g. positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test)) due to
        contraindication of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist use in these individuals and
        also because chronic infection can produce elevations in proinflammatory cytokines; (5)
        presence of an acute infectious illness in the two weeks prior to an experimental session;
        (6) pregnancy or breast-feeding because of the effects on neuroendocrine systems and
        sleep; (7) in women, the presence of vasomotor symptoms due to the effects of such
        symptoms on measures of sleep; (8) use of hormone containing medications including
        steroids; (9) current and/or regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
        medications.

        Exclusion Criteria: Psychiatric Disorders. RA subjects with a current or lifetime history
        of a major Depressive Disorder or other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
        Disorders IV (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorder (e.g. substance dependence) will be excluded
        due to the known effects of major depression on pain. Although depressive symptoms can
        occur in as many as 40% of RA patients, the prevalence of syndromal major depressive
        disorder is considerably less, and we do not anticipate that exclusion of current or
        lifetime history of major depressive disorder will substantially alter subject flow. More
        than 75% of a selected sample of RA subjects at University of California, Los Angeles
        (UCLA) affiliated clinics does not have a history of co-morbid psychiatric disorder.

        Exclusion Criteria: Medication use. Subjects who have used the following medications in
        the past two months will be excluded from the study: (1) previous use of Nitrogen Mustard,
        Cyclosporin, Cytotoxin, or Cyclophosphamide; (2) regular use of analgesics such as
        opioids, (3) regular use of prednisone &gt;10mg of prednisone, (4) psychotropic medications,
        including selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants, anxiolytics,
        hypnotics, sedatives and barbiturates. We will also exclude current smokers because of the
        known effects of tobacco use on proinflammatory cytokine levels. (Helen, I would suggest
        to remove this sentence. It is clear from studies that patients are higher risk for
        susceptibility and increased disease activity with smoking. It may decrease our
        enrollment.)

            <title>Pain Rating Index</title>
            <description>Pain &amp; Stiffness: Repeated assessments of pain and stiffness across the day will utilize the Pain Rating Index (PRI), consisting of the sum of the ranked values associated with adjectives depicting the severity of pain from the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Sixty joints will be evaluated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), to indicate the extent of pain/tenderness and swelling. The final score was summed for this measure with a range from 0 (no pain) to 45 (worst possible pain).</description>

          <description>All subjects will be free of antidepressant medications or opiates, or any other medications used to treat pain for at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of dose titration. Subjects will be allowed to escalate up to 100 mg a day or to their maximum tolerated dose in the course of the first week: Day 1: 12.5 mg once a day; Days 2-3: 25 mg/day (12.5 mg twice daily); Days 4-7: 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily); After Day 7: 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily). The stable-dose phase will be a 10-week period during which patients will take medications at the final dose achieved (either 100 mg per day in divided doses, or the maximum tolerated dose of less than 100 mg per day). Final efficacy assessments will be made at the termination visit, and the study medication will be tapered down following 12 weeks of drug treatment.</description>
