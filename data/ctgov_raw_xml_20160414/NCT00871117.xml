  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Kinrix when
      co-administered with varicella (Varivax® [varicella virus vaccine live], Merck and Company)
      and (measles mumps rubella) MMR vaccines, compared to Kinrix co-administered with MMR
      vaccine alone. Both Kinrix and the second dose of Varivax are indicated in children 4-6
      years of age, and there is great potential for the vaccines to be given concurrently. The
      aim of this trial is to demonstrate that co-administered Varivax does not negatively affect
      the immunogenicity or reactogenicity of Kinrix.

      Subjects 4-6 years of age will be randomized into two groups to receive either Kinrix,
      Varivax and M-M-RII on day 0 (Group 1) or Kinrix and M-M-RII on day 0 and Varivax at month
      1(Group 2).

      All subjects in both groups to provide blood samples prior to vaccination on day 0 and at
      month 1 (for Group 2, blood sampling is prior to vaccination with Varivax).

      Duration of the study will be approximately 6 months for each subject with a safety
      telephone contact 6 months after vaccinations.

        <description>Anti-poliovirus 1, anti-poliovirus 2 and anti-poliovirus 3 booster response:
initially seronegative subjects (pre-booster antibody titer below cut-off of 8 ED50) with an antibody titer ≥ 32 ED50 one month after vaccination
initially seropositive subjects (pre-booster antibody titers ≥ 8 ED50) with an increase at least four times the pre-booster antibody titer one month after vaccination.
ED50 is defined here as the reverse of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. The lowest dilution at which serum samples were tested is 1:8 from which a test was considered positive.</description>
