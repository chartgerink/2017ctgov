  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to get information about the safety of a flu vaccine
      spray, called FluMist, in children with cancer. The study is also being done to find out how
      much and how long the vaccine spray can be found in the nose.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind Phase 1 study of FluMist vs. placebo in mild to
      moderately immunocompromised children 5 to 17 years of age with cancer. The primary
      objective of this study is to describe the safety of FluMist compared with placebo in mild
      to moderately immunocompromised children with cancer. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to describe the immune responses following vaccination with FluMist and to determine the
      incidence and duration of viral replication following vaccination with FluMist.

      The standard 0.5 mL dose of vaccine or placebo was administered intranasally. Patients were
      evaluated at four visits scheduled between days 3-5, days 7-10, days 14-28, and days 35-42
      for viral shedding via nasal swabs. Safety outcomes were collected at study clinic visits or
      by telephone contact through 42 days post dose. Serious adverse events and significant new
      medical conditions were collected through 180 days after receipt of investigational product.

      Immune responses were measured by detection of influenza-specific antibodies as measured by
      the standard hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. Influenza-specific serum antibody
      isotype levels were determined and nasal swab specimens were analyzed for the expression of
      influenza-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA). Serum was analyzed for its ability to neutralize
      viral particles from infecting Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (microneutralization).
      Baseline immunosuppression as measured by expression of T- and B-lymphocyte subsets was
      compared to immunosuppression at time points after vaccination. The duration of viral
      replication and the titers of live-attenuated influenza virus shed was evaluated from nasal
      swab specimens collected at scheduled time points after administration of FluMist.

    <description>Reactogenicity events (REs) are predefined solicited adverse events (AEs) that can potentially occur after vaccine administration. For the participants enrolled in this study REs include fever, runny nose/nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, chills, tiredness, and irritability.</description>

    <description>An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: •Death • Life-threatening • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the offspring of a study participant) • An important medical event that may may jeopardize the study participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigations study participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 20 participants, 10 in the FluMist group and 10 in the placebo group, were enrolled in the study between 08Aug2005 and 31Mar2008 at 4 sites in the USA.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 20 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the FluMist or placebo group. Participants were enrolled on a staggered schedule to assess safety. Four participants were enrolled and treated in 2005, 8 in 2006, and 8 in 2007; each subset was assessed for vaccine-related serious adverse events prior to enrollment of the next subset.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigations study participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</description>
