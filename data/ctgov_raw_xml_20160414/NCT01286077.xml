      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of bortezomib on myeloma-related bone
      disease, analyzing bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with Multiple Myeloma (MMY) who
      have received high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for primary
      treatment of MMY (single- or double-transplant). Eligible patients will be randomized (study
      treatment assigned by chance like flipping a coin) to either bortezomib or observation
      alone. Patients in the bortezomib arm will receive treatment of bortezomib for a total of 4
      cycles. All subjects will be followed for a total of 24 months after randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), multicenter, multi-country parallel group study (each group of patients will
      be treated at the same time) in patients with Multiple Myeloma (MMY) who have received high
      dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for primary treatment of MMY
      (single- or double-transplant). The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of
      bortezomib on myeloma-related bone disease by analyzing bone mineral density. Approximately
      80% of patients with MMY may experience myeloma-related bone disease. Myeloma-related bone
      disease may cause skeletal complications, including bone pain, bone lesions, abnormal
      fractures and super-elevated calcium concentrations in the blood. This study is
      investigating the safety and efficacy of an experimental drug, bortezomib, to consolidate
      the response to the primary treatment compared to no such consolidation treatment. The
      analyses in this study will be exploratory in nature, since the study will not address any
      pre-defined statements but is designed to generate valid hypotheses on safety and efficacy
      issues. Bortezomib is currently marketed for the treatment of different types of cancer
      including MMY. Bortezomib has been shown to promote bone formation and increase the number
      of bone-regenerating cells in preliminary studies. In the present study, the effect of
      bortezomib on bone formation will be assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      measuring bone mineral density, which is a measure for the quality of the bone structures.
      Several bone markers will be measured on serum samples. Bone markers are indicators of the
      bone activity. Patients will be evaluated for eligibility within a 14-day screening period,
      after providing written informed consent. Eligible patients will then be randomised to
      either bortezomib or observation alone. Baseline efficacy and safety assessments should be
      available on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to administration of study medication. Randomization will
      be stratified by bisphosphonate treatment (use or not) at baseline and age (65 years or more
      versus less than 65 years). The treatment period is defined as the time the patient is
      actively receiving study treatment. Patients in the bortezomib arm will receive treatment of
      bortezomib for a total of 4 cycles or until start of alternative MMY treatment if earlier.
      Each cycle will consist of 5 weeks treatment. Subjects in the treatment group will receive
      bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle followed by a 13-day rest period
      (Days 23 to 35). Bisphosphonate therapy can be administered as medically indicated and
      according to local practice. Patients are to attend study center visits on Days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 of each treatment cycle or at Days 1, 36, 71, and 106 in the observation arm and at
      end of treatment (EOT) Visit. During these visits, different evaluations will be conducted
      to follow treatment safety: symptom directed physical examination, vital signs and
      laboratory tests. In addition, at Day 1 of Cycle 3 (prior to dosing) or Day 71 in the
      observation arm, patients will be assessed for disease progression or relapse by
      measurements of M-protein in serum and urine. If needed, absence of M-protein in serum and
      urine will be confirmed by immunofixation. Additional evaluations may be performed to
      document patient's clinical status and ability to tolerate additional therapy as clinically
      indicated. All patients will be followed for a total of 24 months since baseline. After end
      of the treatment phase, there will be a long-term follow-up period with visits at 4, 6, 12
      and 18 months after the EOT Visit. In case the patient started alternative MMY treatment
      before completing the 18 months of follow-up, study assessments will stop, except for QoL
      assessments, which are to be continued up to 18 months of follow-up, and for a long-term
      follow-up for survival, which will be collected every 6 months by either a telephone call or
      a visit to the study site. The follow-up for survival will continue for all patients until
      the last patient has completed follow-up. In addition to scheduled visits, patients may have
      additional visits as clinically indicated. Every patient who was randomized should enter the
      long-term follow-up phase. Assessment of progressive disease (PD) or relapse from complete
      response (CR) should be performed according to the International Myeloma Working Group
      (IMWG) 2009 criteria. Changes in serum and urine M-protein (monoclonal paraprotein) levels
      will be confirmed by immunofixation in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein
      levels. Karnofsky performance status will also be assessed. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring of adverse events, physical examination (including neurological/peripheral
      neurological examinations), vital signs measurements and clinical laboratory tests. A total
      of two exploratory analyses will be performed for the present study: The first analysis
      (main analysis) will be presented after completion of the EOT Visit (24-weeks data). The
      second analysis will be the analysis at the end of the study on 18 months follow-up data.
      Patients in the bortezomib arm will receive treatment of bortezomib 1.6 mg/m² as a bolus
      infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 5 weeks for a total of 4 cycles
