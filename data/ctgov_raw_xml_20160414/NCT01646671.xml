      This study assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCZ696 in severe hypertensive
      Japanese patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Summaries for treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and death were
      provided by the following actual treatment regimen (actual treatment patients received) in
      addition to all patients: LCZ696 200mg, 400mg, 400mg+other hypertensive medications.

      Summaries for others than above were provided by the following treatment regimen (determined
      by the maximal treatment patients received) in addition to all patients: LCZ696 200mg,
      400mg, 400mg+other hypertensive medications.
