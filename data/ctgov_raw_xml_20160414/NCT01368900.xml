    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, multi-center, single treatment study is to evaluate the
      clinical outcomes associated with the non-invasive treatment to reduce wrinkles around the
      eyes utilizing the Ulthera® System to deliver focused ultrasound energy below the surface of
      the skin.

      <recruitment_details>Sixty-eight subjects were enrolled at two aesthetic medical facilities. Study recruitment was initiated on March 3, 2011, and concluded on July 13, 2011. Forty-five subjects were enrolled at one study site; 23 subjects were enrolled at the second study site.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects presenting with rhytids and skin laxity in the periorbital region, Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Classification Scale (FWCS)of 3 to 7, qualified for study participation. Note: A protocol amendment restricting enrollment to FWCS scores of 3-7 occurred after 19 subjects with FWCS = 2 had been enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The FWCS, a 9 point scale used to classify wrinkle severity, was used to qualify subjects for study participation.
Score 1-3 = Fine wrinkles; 4-6 = Fine to moderate-depth wrinkles, moderate number of lines; 7-9 = Fine to deep wrinkles, Numerous lines with or without redundant skin folds.
All study subjects received an Ulthera treatment to the upper face.</description>

        <population>Primary endpoint: Three masked assessors reviewed pre- and 90 days post-treatment photos, assessing each eye separately. 41 right, 42 left eye photos were found to be usable. Photos excluded had photographic lighting, focus and exposure inconsistencies obscuring key physical details making pre- vs. post-treatment photo comparisons impossible.</population>
