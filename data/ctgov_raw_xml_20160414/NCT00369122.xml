    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with radiation therapy
      and cisplatin works in treating patients with previously untreated locally advanced cervical
      cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of cervical cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and
      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine treatment-related serious adverse-event rates and adverse-event rates within
      the first 90 days from treatment start in patients with previously untreated locally
      advanced carcinoma of the cervix treated with bevacizumab, cisplatin, and concurrent pelvic
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate treatment-related serious adverse events and adverse events at any time.

      II. Evaluate disease-free survival (local, regional, or distant failure, or death due to any
      cause).

      III. Evaluate overall survival (death due to any cause). IV. Implement the image-based
      brachytherapy guidelines proposed by the Transatlantic Image-Guided Brachytherapy Working
      Group.

      V. Collect CT scan or MRI-based dosimetry of brachytherapy applications used during the
      course of treatment for later analysis of feasibility and consistency as well as dose/volume
      assessments of tumor control and complications.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 5
      weeks for a total of 45 Gy.

      Some patients also undergo low-dose rate brachytherapy twice, 1-3 weeks apart, beginning &gt;=
      4 weeks after initiating EBRT or high-dose rate brachytherapy 5 times, &gt;= 48 hours apart,
      beginning &gt;= 2 weeks after initiating EBRT. EBRT and chemotherapy are halted on the day of
      high-dose rate brachytherapy. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1,
      15, and 29 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 35.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

    <description>Treatment-related SAEs defined as Grade (Gr) &gt;= 4 vaginal bleeding, Gr &gt;=4 thrombotic event, Gr &gt;=3 arterial event, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , or bowel/bladder perforation, and any Gr 5 treatment-related AE. Treatment-related AEs defined as all SAEs, Gr 3-4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea persisting for &gt;2 weeks depsite medical intervention, Gr 4 neutropenia or leukopenia persisiting for &gt;7 days, febrile neutropenia defined as a temperature &gt;38.5 degree Celsius and granulocytes &lt; 1000/mm3, Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity with the exception of neutropenia and leukopenia, and Grade 3-4 GI, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or neurologic AEs. Based on a report by Laciano, et al. an SAE rate of 5% and AE rate of 35% were considered tolerable and an SAE rate &gt;=20% and AE rate &gt;=55% excessive. If there were &gt;=6 pts with SAES or &gt;=22 pts with AEs then the treatment would be rejected. This study design provides alpha of 0.05 and power of 90%.</description>

        <title>Subjects With Treatment-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) as Assessed by CTCAE v. 3.0 Criteria Within the First 90 Days From Treatment Start.</title>
        <description>Treatment-related SAEs defined as Grade (Gr) &gt;= 4 vaginal bleeding, Gr &gt;=4 thrombotic event, Gr &gt;=3 arterial event, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , or bowel/bladder perforation, and any Gr 5 treatment-related AE. Treatment-related AEs defined as all SAEs, Gr 3-4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea persisting for &gt;2 weeks depsite medical intervention, Gr 4 neutropenia or leukopenia persisiting for &gt;7 days, febrile neutropenia defined as a temperature &gt;38.5 degree Celsius and granulocytes &lt; 1000/mm3, Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity with the exception of neutropenia and leukopenia, and Grade 3-4 GI, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or neurologic AEs. Based on a report by Laciano, et al. an SAE rate of 5% and AE rate of 35% were considered tolerable and an SAE rate &gt;=20% and AE rate &gt;=55% excessive. If there were &gt;=6 pts with SAES or &gt;=22 pts with AEs then the treatment would be rejected. This study design provides alpha of 0.05 and power of 90%.</description>
