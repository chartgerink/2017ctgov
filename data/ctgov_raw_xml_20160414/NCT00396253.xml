  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase III, open-label study conducted at 44 centers in the United States, Canada,
      and Puerto Rico. 223 subjects who required hemodialysis (HD) and had a dysfunctional HD
      catheter were enrolled in the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of four visits that corresponded to consecutive HD sessions for each
      patient, as well as one follow-up visit. Patients could receive up to three treatments with
      open-label tenecteplase during the study: one or two treatments during an initial treatment
      course, and eligible patients whose catheter became dysfunctional again within 21 days of
      the first visit received an additional treatment as part of a retreatment (RT) course.

      At Visit 1, patients eligible at the beginning of HD had 2 mL (2 mg) of tenecteplase
      instilled into each of the two lumens of the HD catheter. After a dwell time of 1 hour,
      study drug was withdrawn and all subjects underwent HD. The duration of the HD session was
      not fixed by the study protocol, but rather by the site's HD practice, physician orders, and
      individual patient response during the session. Patients who did not experience treatment
      success at the end of Visit 1 had 2 mL (2 mg) of tenecteplase instilled into each lumen of
      their catheter as part of the initial treatment course. The treatment was left to dwell for
      an extended time, until the second HD session at Visit 2 (up to 72 hours later). Patients
      who received extended-dwell tenecteplase had the treatment withdrawn from their catheter at
      the beginning of Visit 2. Patients underwent HD as prescribed or to the extent possible.

      Patients who had treatment success at Visit 1 or Visit 2 and had a recurrence of catheter
      dysfunction within 21 days of Visit 1 and met the re-treatment eligibility criteria had 2 mL
      (2 mg) of tenecteplase instilled into each lumen, followed by a 1-hour dwell time at
      re-treatment Visit 1.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had Treatment Success With Respect to Blood Flow Rate (BFR) at Visit 1</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as Blood Flow Rate (BFR) ≥ 300 mL/min and an increase of ≥ 25 mL/min from baseline BFR (without reversal of lines), at an associated arterial pressure in the range of 0 to −280 mmHg, 30 (± 10) minutes prior to the end of hemodialysis and at the end of hemodialysis.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the number of targeted adverse events, occurring from initial study drug administration through the end of Visit 1 (prior to administration of open-label, extended-dwell tenecteplase) or, for subjects who did not receive open-label, extended-dwell tenecteplase, from initial study administration through the start of Visit 2. Targeted adverse events were defined as intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding and embolic events, thrombosis, Catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSIs), and catheter-related complications.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>For patients with treatment success at Visit 1 or Visit 2, maintenance of catheter function at subsequent visits was defined as a BFR ≥ 300 mL/min and an increase of ≥ 25 mL/min from baseline BFR (without reversal of lines), at an associated target arterial pressure in the range of 0 to -280 mmHg at the beginning of that HD session (within the first 30 minutes).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients who failed treatment at Visit 1 and were treated with extended-dwell tenecteplase were analyzed for Treatment Success at Visit 2.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Failed Treatment at Visit 1 With Treatment Success at Visit 2</title>
        <description>Patients who failed treatment at Visit 1 and were treated with extended-dwell tenecteplase were analyzed for Treatment Success at Visit 2. Treatment success at Visit 2 was defined as a BFR ≥ 300 mL/min, without line reversal, and increase of ≥ 25 mL/min from baseline BFR, at an associated target arterial pressure in the range of 0 to −280 mmHg, 30 (± 10) minutes prior to the end of HD and at the end of HD.</description>
        <time_frame>BFR was measured 30 minutes before the end of HD and at the end of HD at Visit 2 (2nd consecutive HD session, within 72 hours of Visit 1). Baseline BFR was measured at the beginning of HD at Visit 1.</time_frame>

The first treatment, followed by a 1-hour dwell time, was given to all patients at Visit 1. At the end of hemodialysis at Visit 1, eligible patients had a second treatment instilled for an extended dwell time until the start of Visit 2 (up to 72 hours).</description>
