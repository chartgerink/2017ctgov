    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied
      to the left dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex transiently improves performance of memory
      and attention. Investigator assessed the effects of left DLPF-tDCS on Coma Recovery
      Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores in severely brain damaged patients with disorders of
      consciousness in a double-blind sham-controlled experimental design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following severe brain damage and coma, some patients may remain in a vegetative state (VS)
      or minimally conscious state (MCS). At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines
      regarding the treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC).

      Investigator aim to assess the effect of single session anodal (i.e., excitatory)
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPF) on the level of consciousness in DOC patients in a double blind randomized sham
      controlled study.

      tDCS is a form of safe non-invasive cortical stimulation, modulating cortical excitability
      at stimulation sites via weak polarizing currents, previously reported to transiently
      improve working memory and attention by stimulating the left DLPF in healthy subjects and
      patients with stroke, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.

    <description>At the group level, assess the modification of CRS-R total scores in anodal tDCS as compared to sham stimulation in VS/UWS and MCS populations
The Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) is a behavioral scale performed at the patient's bedside. It consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise 6 subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, verbal, communication, and arousal functions.
Scoring is based on the presence or absence of specific behavioral responses to sensory stimuli administered in a standardized manner. Maximum scores of each subscale are summed to obtain the total score (from 0 to 23).
The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>
