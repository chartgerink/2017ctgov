        <description>EPIC Sexual Domain is an HRQoL instrument that measures the effects of prostate cancer treatment on a patient's sexual function and sexual satisfaction. Best change from baseline category in EPIC sexual domain summary score is summarized below. Categories are worsened (decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference), stable (changed by less than 1 minimally important difference), or improved (increase of at least 1 minimally important difference). Minimally important difference is defined as one-half the standard deviation of the score of interest at baseline.</description>

        <title>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL): The Twelve-Item Short Form Version 2 Physical Functioning Domain Score</title>
        <description>The Twelve-Item Short Form Version 2 is an HRQoL instrument that measures general health and well-being across physical and mental components. Best change from baseline category in physical functioning domain score is summarized below. Categories are worsened (decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference), stable (changed by less than 1 minimally important difference), or improved (increase of at least 1 minimally important difference). Minimally important difference is defined as one-half the standard deviation of the score of interest at baseline.</description>
