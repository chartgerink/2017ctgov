    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability, and number of positive
      response to treatment with CAELYX (50 mg/m^2), administered as monotherapy once per 4 weeks
      to patients with metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, resistant to previous platinum
      therapy.

Reappearance of lesion, worsening of assessable disease or appearance new lesions were considered progression as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
