    <textblock>
      A study in healthy volunteers of the next morning driving performance after
      middle-of-the-night dosing of 3.5 mg zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablet, a sleep aid. The
      next morning driving performance will be measured by taking a standardized driving test.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>SDLP was measured by an infrared camera mounted on the car's roof during a highway driving test. Lateral position of the car relative to the left lane boundary was recorded. The data summarizes the number of participants whose driving performance was worse, neutral or improved as compared to placebo at the 2.5 cm threshold. A neutral driving performance shows a difference of SDLP &gt;= 2.5 cm and &lt;= -2.5 cm when compared to placebo. A worse performance is when the difference of SDLP &gt; 2.5 cm, and an improved performance is when the difference of SDLP &lt; -2.5 cm.</description>

    <description>This table represents the probability of driving performance changes summarized in the previous table. It answers the question: What is the chance that # participants out of the total number of participants had better (or worse) driving performance? Probability values of &lt;.001 are listed in the data table as 0.000.
A symmetry analysis was conducted for the probability of difference in mean SDLP (treatment) - mean SDLP (placebo) exceeding thresholds. Statistically significant asymmetries indicate a decrement in driving performance.</description>

    <description>Standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) in a highway-driving lane is a surrogate measure for driving performance. It measures the driver's ability to stay in a constant position within the driving lane. Variations in the lateral position are recorded and analyzed.</description>

    <description>Adverse Events were graded by the investigator using the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Event Grading Scale and were assessed for severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relatedness (summarized as 'unrelated' and 'related') to study treatment. Also included are counts of participants with serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, and deaths.</description>

            <description>Adverse Events were graded by the investigator using the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Event Grading Scale and were assessed for severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relatedness (summarized as 'unrelated' and 'related') to study treatment. Also included are counts of participants with serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, and deaths.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Whose Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) Following Active Treatment As Compared to Placebo In Relation To The 2.5 cm SDLP Threshold</title>
        <description>SDLP was measured by an infrared camera mounted on the car’s roof during a highway driving test. Lateral position of the car relative to the left lane boundary was recorded. The data summarizes the number of participants whose driving performance was worse, neutral or improved as compared to placebo at the 2.5 cm threshold. A neutral driving performance shows a difference of SDLP &gt;= 2.5 cm and &lt;= -2.5 cm when compared to placebo. A worse performance is when the difference of SDLP &gt; 2.5 cm, and an improved performance is when the difference of SDLP &lt; -2.5 cm.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Whose Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) Following Active Treatment As Compared to Placebo In Relation To The 2.0 cm SDLP Threshold</title>
        <description>SDLP was measured by an infrared camera mounted on the car's roof during a highway driving test. Lateral position of the car relative to the left lane boundary was recorded. The data summarizes the number of participants whose driving performance was worse, neutral or improved as compared to placebo at the 2.0 cm threshold. A neutral driving performance shows a difference of SDLP &gt;= 2.0 cm and &lt;= -2.0 cm when compared to placebo. A worse performance is when the difference of SDLP &gt; 2.0 cm, and an improved performance is when the difference of SDLP &lt; -2.0 cm.</description>

            <title>Probability of Differences From Placebo Exceeding The 3.5 cm Threshold in Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) Following Administration of Active Therapy</title>
            <description>This table represents the probability of driving performance changes summarized in the previous table. It answers the question: What is the chance that # participants out of the total number of participants had better (or worse) driving performance? Probability values of &lt;.001 are listed in the data table as 0.000.
A symmetry analysis was conducted for the probability of difference in mean SDLP (treatment) - mean SDLP (placebo) exceeding thresholds. Statistically significant asymmetries indicate a decrement in driving performance.</description>
