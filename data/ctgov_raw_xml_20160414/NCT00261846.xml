  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, continuous daily dosing, two-part safety and efficacy study of
      SKI-606 (bosutinib) in Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias (Ph+). Part 1 is a
      dose-escalation study in chronic phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) subjects to
      establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this subject population. Part 2 has begun
      after the completion of Part 1 and after a dose has been established for the compound in
      chronic phase subjects. Part 2 is a study of the the efficacy of 500mg daily oral SKI-606
      (bosutinib) in patients with all phases of Ph+ CML and Ph+ Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).
      The protocol will test the hypotheses that oral daily dosing of bosutinib at 500 mg will
      attain (1) Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) in chronic phase CML patients and (2) Overall
      Hematological Response (OHR) in advanced leukemia patients. Each phase of the disease will
      be evaluated as a separate cohort.

            <description>AUC is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption. There were fewer participants evaluable for AUC values than participants evaluable for AUClast because terminal half-life of some participants was not accurately estimated and therefore AUC in these participants was not calculated.</description>

            <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia positive (Ph+) cells. Major cytogenetic response was categorized as either complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR). CCyR was achieved when there was 0 percent (%) Ph+ cells and PCyR was achieved when 1 to 35% Ph+ cells.</description>

            <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia positive (Ph+) cells in metaphase from Bone Marrow (BM) sample.

            <title>Time to Achieve Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) in Chronic Phase Second-line CML and Chronic Phase Third-line CML - Part 2</title>
            <description>Time to MCyR was the interval from the date of first dose of study medication until the first date of achieving a given response.
Time to response in weeks = (event date - first dose date plus 1)/7, where the event date is the non-missing date of the first attained response or last cytogenetic assessment date of a participants. Major cytogenetic response was categorized as either complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR). CCyR was achieved when there was 0 percent (%) Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM and PCyR was achieved when 1 to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM.</description>

        <description>PFS was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as time in weeks from start of study treatment to treatment discontinuation due to disease progression as assessed by the investigator. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from death case report forms (CRFs).</description>

            <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
