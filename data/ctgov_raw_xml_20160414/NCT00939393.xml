      Endoscopic sinus surgery will be performed either in the physician's office or in the
      operating room (OR). Patients treated in the physician's office will have endoscopic sinus
      surgery performed with balloon sinuplasty devices. Patients treated in the OR will have
      endoscopic sinus surgery performed with or without balloon sinuplasty devices.

      In this study, endoscopic sinus surgery will be performed either in the physician's office
      or in the operating room (OR). Patients treated in the physician's office will have
      endoscopic sinus surgery performed with the balloon sinuplasty devices. Patients treated in
      the OR will have endoscopic sinus surgery performed with or without balloon sinuplasty
      devices. Both primary treatment of sinusitis as well as revision of previously treated
      sinuses will be allowed. Resource absorption will be evaluated for both venues.

    <measure>Mean Intra-patient Change in SNOT-20 Score at 24 Weeks Post-procedure Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 20 question Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) will be used to evaluate sinus symptoms and sinus-symptom related quality of life (QOL) at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks post-procedure. The change in SNOT-20 score at each post-procedure time point will be evaluated compared to baseline SNOT-20 score. Each of the 20 questions in the SNOT-20 survey is scored on a scale of 0 to 5, where '0' represents 'no problem' and '5' represents 'problem as bad as it can be'. The 20 questions are expressed as a mean of the scores. Therefore, the minimum mean score is zero and the maximum mean score is 5.</description>

    <measure>Mean Intra-patient Change in Lund-MacKay CT Score [24 Weeks]</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The Lund-MacKay (LMK) CT (computed tomography) score is a scoring system to evaluate radiographic opacification of the paranasal sinuses. The LMK score will be evaluated at 24 weeks post-procedure compared to baseline. The LMK scoring system rates each of both the left and right frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ostiomeatal complex, anterior ethmoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses on a scale of 0 to 2, where '0' is 'no opacification' and '2' is 'complete opacification'. The scores for a given subject are totaled and expressed as the LMK score, where zero is the minimum score, and 24 is the maximum score. A higher score represents greater sinus disease burden.</description>

    <description>Participants evaluated the tolerability of their balloon dilation in office (IO = In Office) procedure on a scale from zero to 5, where '0' represented 'not tolerated' and '5' represented 'highly tolerable'. Scores of 3 through 5 were consdered tolerable ratings. The endpoint reports the proportion of participants rating the procedure as tolerable.</description>

    <description>Participants evaluated the per-procedural pain of their balloon dilation in office (IO = In Office) procedure on a scale from zero to 5, where '0' represented 'no pain' and '5' represented 'intense pain'. Scores of 0 through 2 were considered ratings of no pain or pain of low intensity. The endpoint reports the proportion of participants reporting no pain or pain of low intensity.</description>

    <description>A debridement is a procedure to remove post-surgical crusts, mucus, and fibrin from obstructed nasal and sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Each physician visit in which a debridement was performed was counted as one debridement.</description>

    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>After sinus surgery, the patient may require a subsequent sinus procedure (a revision procedure) to address recurrence of disease. These revision procedures are assessed in this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Post-operative Sinus Infections</measure>

    <description>Investigators reported the sinus infections as secondary to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) or other pre-existing conditions such as allergies. The rates of these sinus infections are consistent with the disease burden of the subjects and consistent with post procedure symptomatology associated with endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).</description>

            <description>The Lund-MacKay (LMK) CT (computed tomography) score is a scoring system to evaluate radiographic opacification of the paranasal sinuses. The LMK score will be evaluated at 24 weeks post-procedure compared to baseline. The LMK scoring system rates each of both the left and right frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ostiomeatal complex, anterior ethmoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses on a scale of 0 to 2, where '0' is 'no opacification' and '2' is 'complete opacification'. The scores for a given subject are totaled and expressed as the LMK score, where zero is the minimum score, and 24 is the maximum score. A higher score represents greater sinus disease burden.</description>

Each of the 20 questions in the SNOT-20 survey is scored on a scale of 0 to 5, where '0' represents 'no problem' and '5' represents 'problem as bad as it can be'. The 20 questions are expressed as a mean of the scores. Therefore, the minimum mean score is zero and the maximum mean score is 5.</description>

The 20 questions are expressed as a mean of the scores. Therefore, the minimum mean score is zero and the maximum mean score is 5.</description>
