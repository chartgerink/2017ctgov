  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this proposal is that in subjects with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) and
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with intermittent claudication (IC), regular consumption
      of a high nitrate supplement which raises plasma nitrite, in conjunction with 12 weeks of
      supervised exercise training at the limb ischemic threshold (SET) will produce a greater
      clinical benefit (increases in claudication onset time [COT] and peak walking time [PWT]
      relative to a group with the same exercise training but supplemented with placebo .This
      study is essentially exploratory in nature and designed to provide us with information to
      adequately develop power and execute a larger study. We have previously seen benefits from
      nitrate supplementation on function in PAD.

    <description>Six-Minute Walk test. This test simple and practical assessment of functional capacity. The test measures the distance that a patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. The test is self-paced and assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. The subjects choose their own intensity and are allowed to stop and rest if necessary during the test.</description>

    <description>Gastrocnemius muscle biopsy will be performed to measure markers of angiogenesis including; capillaries per unit area and per muscle fiber, endothelial cells with surrounding pericytes, relative fraction of type I, IIa, IIb, and IId/x fibers. If differences exist we will look for changes in cell proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (TUNEL); (b) oxidative capacity including; mitochondria volume with citrate synthase activity. (c) mitochondrial volume and density; (d) mitochondrial oxygen efficiency (respiratory control ratio, the ratio of ATP phosphorylation rate per oxygen consumption rate (P/O ratio), and maximal rate of ATP production). These are measurements for potential mediation analyses and gaining insight into the relative effect sizes will inform mechanistic aims in a larger trial.</description>

        <description>Six-Minute Walk test. This test simple and practical assessment of functional capacity. The test measures the distance that a patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. The test is self-paced and assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. The subjects choose their own intensity and are allowed to stop and rest if necessary during the test.</description>

            <description>Subjects consume 70 ml of Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot) to assess acute effects of beverage supplementation at the start (between Testing Visits 1 &amp; 2) and at the end of the trial (between Visits 3 &amp; 4). It also allows for comparisons of the combination of beetroot juice and chronic training effects (between Visits 2 &amp; 3) to when the subject has not consumed the beverage (Visits 1 &amp; 4). All subjects will consume Beet-It Stamina Shot 3 hours prior to all beverage tolerance visits, Testing Visits 2 &amp; 3 and for all supervised exercise training visits during the 12 week intervention.
Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot) and Exercise Training: The beverage is high in inorganic nitrate and bottled and supplied by James White Drinks. This supplement will be used in conjunction with supervised exercise training.</description>

        <description>Gastrocnemius muscle biopsy will be performed to measure markers of angiogenesis including; capillaries per unit area and per muscle fiber, endothelial cells with surrounding pericytes, relative fraction of type I, IIa, IIb, and IId/x fibers. If differences exist we will look for changes in cell proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (TUNEL); (b) oxidative capacity including; mitochondria volume with citrate synthase activity. (c) mitochondrial volume and density; (d) mitochondrial oxygen efficiency (respiratory control ratio, the ratio of ATP phosphorylation rate per oxygen consumption rate (P/O ratio), and maximal rate of ATP production). These are measurements for potential mediation analyses and gaining insight into the relative effect sizes will inform mechanistic aims in a larger trial.</description>
