  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immune response against Hepatitis-A (HAV) and Hepatitis B
      surface (HBs) antigen in healthy subjects aged 12 to 15 years (at the time of primary
      vaccination), who received vaccination course with GSK Biologicals' Twinrix Adult and
      Twinrix Junior vaccine, approximately 10 years ago in the primary study. The subjects will
      be invited for blood sampling at 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years after primary vaccination to
      evaluate the persistence of immune response. For subjects detected with decreased immunity,
      the presence of immune memory against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the
      administration of a challenge dose of the appropriate vaccine 6 to 12 months after the Year
      15 follow-up time-point.

      No new subjects will be recruited during this booster phase of the study.

             period outside the context of the study.

          -  Administration of a hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis combination vaccine between
             the primary vaccination course of the primary study and the challenge dose visit.

          -  History of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the challenge dose.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccines.

          -  Acute disease at the time of.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of the challenge dose or planned administration before
             the final blood sampling point (one month after the challenge dose).
