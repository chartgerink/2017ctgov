  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an herb called chamomile can help to treat
      insomnia (difficulty in going to sleep or getting enough sleep) by increasing the amount of
      time that you sleep and/or improving the quality of your sleep. The study will also be
      looking at the effect of chamomile on day time fatigue and functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia, defined as the inability to initiate or maintain sleep or lack of restorative
      sleep, is the most prevalent sleep complaint in primary care. Insomnia is associated with
      decreased quality of life, work limitations and increased healthcare utilization. Currently
      there is no treatment for chronic insomnia that is readily available, affordable, without
      significant side-effects and demonstrated to be safe for long term use. Consequently,
      treatments that would fill this gap are needed.

      Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) has been used as a gentle sleep agent by herbalists for
      several hundred years. It has been studied in animals for its sedative potential and shows
      promise for treating insomnia. Currently, chamomile's sedative mechanisms of action are
      unknown, but are thought to be through the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central
      nervous system, γ - aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, no study has examined chamomile's
      efficacy and safety for treating insomnia.

      The investigators propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of chamomile
      in primary care patients with chronic insomnia. Thirty-four patients will be randomized to
      either Chamomile High Grade Extract, three 5 mg tablets standardized to 0.4% (-)-α-bisabolol
      twice daily or placebo and will be followed for 28 days for changes in a sleep diary (sleep
      efficiency, total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and sleep quality), insomnia severity and
      sleep disturbances. Secondary endpoints include assessing changes in day time functioning
      (measures of global quality of life, depression and anxiety) and monitoring for any signs of
      toxicity. The investigators will also determine the feasibility of conducting a larger trial
      with this agent.

the change from baseline of daily self-report of sleep as assessed by a sleep diary that includes determination of: (i) sleep efficiency, which equals &quot;The total sleep time divided by time-in-bed, multiplied by 100.&quot; This measure is our primary aim (SE); Secondary aims include - (ii) total sleep time (TST); (iii) sleep-onset latency (SOL); (iv) and sleep quality (SQ);
the change from baseline of global sleep and insomnia symptoms as determined by the (i) Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); and (ii) Insomnia Severity Index (ISI);</description>
