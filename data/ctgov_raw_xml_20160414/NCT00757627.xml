    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The change from baseline in 3 domain scores (pain, stiffness, and difficult in doing daily activity) of WOMAC at week 4 were measured. Each domain comprises of questions and VAS scales for scoring. For pain domain, 0 represents no pain and 100 represents extreme pain; for stiffness domain, 0 represents no stiffness and 100 represents extreme stiffness; for difficult in doing daily activity domain, 0 represents no difficulty and 100 represents most difficulty.</description>
