            <title>Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titer Against Each of the Three Vaccine Influenza Strains.</title>
            <description>MGI was defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Day 0). The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), Flu A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) and Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata). This outcome measure was assessed by influenza vaccination status in subjects (18-60 years and &gt;60 years) who had and who had not received an influenza vaccine during the 2012/2013 influenza season.</description>

            <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms.</title>
            <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, shivering, increased sweating and fever [oral temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Any = any solicited general symptom reported irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related = symptoms considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature above 39.0°C</description>
