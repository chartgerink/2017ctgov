  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of
      the new influenza vaccine GSK2282512A (FLU-Q-QIV) and compare its activity to the marketed
      vaccine Fluarix® (TIV) in young children 6 to 35 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomized (1:1) in the 2 treatment groups to explore responses to
      vaccination in a sub-group analysis based on age (6 to 17 months, 18 to 35 months).

            <description>A seroprotected subject was defined as a vaccinated subject with a serum HI titer greater than or equal to (≥) 1:40 that usually is accepted as indicating protection in adults. The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/CAL/7/09 (H1N1), Flu A/Victoria/361/11 (H3N2), Flu B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/09 (Yamagata) and Flu B/Bri/60/08 (Victoria)</description>
