  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability
      of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with chronic
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

      The optimal treatment for adolescents with chronic HBV infection is currently unknown.
      Treatment with interferon alfa, lamivudine, and adefovir dipivoxil in pediatric populations
      has been shown to be less than optimal. Further, the safety and efficacy of entecavir and
      telbivudine have not been established in patients &lt; 16 years of age. A study evaluating TDF
      in adolescents (ages 12-17) was needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this agent in
      the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in this patient population. In addition, the study will
      help to further elucidate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and resistance profiles of TDF. Through
      their participation, study participants will help generate critical new information to help
      guide the most optimal treatment of chronic HBV infection in adolescents.

      This is a randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of TDF versus placebo in adolescents with chronic HBV infection. One hundred
      TDF treatment-naive participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TDF or placebo. After 72
      weeks of blinded treatment, all participants were to switch to open-label TDF for an
      additional 2.5 years of treatment, provided that no safety concerns are identified by the
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee monitoring the study.

    <description>The percentage of participants with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at Week 72 was summarized by treatment and age group (grouped by baseline age for analysis), using the missing = failure (M = F) analysis with the double-blind efficacy evaluation (DBEE) algorithm.
In the M = F analysis method, all missing data were considered as failure to meet the outcome measure threshold. This method was combined with the DBEE algorithm, which included all available data for the double-blind period, and any data for the open-label period were not included; data generated during treatment-free follow-up from subjects who achieved HBsAg loss and entered treatment-free follow-up during double-blind treatment period were included.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at 3 sites in the United States, 8 sites in Poland, 3 sites in Romania, 2 sites in Bulgaria, 2 sites in France, 2 sites in Spain, and 1 site in Turkey. The first participant was screened on 15 December 2008. The last participant observation for the Week 72 analysis was on 01 March 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>149 participants were screened; randomization was stratified according to age and location of study site (North America, Europe); 106 were randomized and treated (52 TDF/54 placebo) and formed the Randomized Analysis Set, the Full Analysis Set, and the Safety Analysis Set. Participants randomized to TDF formed the Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBV Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) &lt; 400 Copies/mL at Week 72</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at Week 72 was summarized by treatment and age group (grouped by baseline age for analysis), using the missing = failure (M = F) analysis with the double-blind efficacy evaluation (DBEE) algorithm.
In the M = F analysis method, all missing data were considered as failure to meet the outcome measure threshold. This method was combined with the DBEE algorithm, which included all available data for the double-blind period, and any data for the open-label period were not included; data generated during treatment-free follow-up from subjects who achieved HBsAg loss and entered treatment-free follow-up during double-blind treatment period were included.</description>

            <description>The percentage of participants with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at Week 72 was summarized by treatment and age group (grouped by baseline age for analysis), using the missing = failure (M = F) analysis with the double-blind efficacy evaluation (DBEE) algorithm.
In the M = F analysis method, all missing data were considered as failure to meet the outcome measure threshold. This method was combined with the DBEE algorithm, which included all available data for the double-blind period, and any data for the open-label period were not included; data generated during treatment-free follow-up from subjects who achieved HBsAg loss and entered treatment-free follow-up during double-blind treatment period were included.</description>

        <title>Change in Z-score for Spine BMD at Week 48</title>
        <description>The change in mean (SD) Z-score for spine BMD at Week 48 was summarized. To assess any effect of treatment on growth, Z-scores were used to express the deviation from a reference population for lumbar spine BMD. A Z-score of 0 indicated that a subject was typical of the population for their age, ethnicity, and gender. A negative Z-score indicated that the subject’s recorded value was lower than typical for their age, ethnicity, and gender. A positive Z-score indicates that the subject’s recorded value was higher than typical for their age, ethnicity, and gender.</description>

        <description>The change in mean (SD) Z-score for whole body BMD at Week 48 was summarized. To assess any effect of treatment on growth, Z-scores were used to express the deviation from a reference population for whole body spine BMD. A Z-score of 0 indicated that a subject was typical of the population for their age, ethnicity, and gender. A negative Z-score indicated that the subject's recorded value was lower than typical for their age, ethnicity, and gender. A positive Z-score indicates that the subject's recorded value was higher than typical for their age, ethnicity, and gender.</description>
