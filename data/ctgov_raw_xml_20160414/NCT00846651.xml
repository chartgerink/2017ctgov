      Many women experience low blood pressure after spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section. This
      low blood pressure may result in nausea, vomiting dizziness and impairment of uterine blood
      flow.The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for preventing low blood pressure
      associated with spinal anesthesia during Cesarean sections. In both methods, we will attempt
      to prevent low blood pressure using phenylephrine infusion that has been shown to be
      effective in recent research. In addition to receiving phenylephrine one group of patients
      will receive standard salt solution (Ringer's lactate solution), while the other group will
      receive a different, intravenous fluid called hydroxyethylstarch.

    <description>The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10 with higher scores being better than lower scores. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form an acronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).</description>

        <description>The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10 with higher scores being better than lower scores. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form an acronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).</description>
