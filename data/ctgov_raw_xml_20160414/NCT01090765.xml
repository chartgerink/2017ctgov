  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Currently, there is no curative therapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
           cancer (CRPC), a leading cause of death in men. However, researchers are exploring new
           treatments that involve drugs that prevent angiogenesis (the process by which new blood
           vessels are formed) and can slow or prevent tumor growth.

        -  TRC105 is an experimental drug that blocks angiogenesis, and has been studied for
           possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. However, it has not been validated
           to treat prostate cancer in general or CRPC in particular.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the effects of TRC105 as a treatment for CRPC

        -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in treating CRPC

      Eligibility:

      - Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer for which existing treatments have not been effective.

      Design:

        -  Eligible individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their
           suitability for participating in the study.

        -  Participants will receive intravenous infusions of TRC105 in a 28-day treatment cycle.
           Participants will receive i.v. (intravenous) infusions of TRC105 every two weeks on
           days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) and every week on days
           1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28 day cycle (cohort 4).

        -  Participants will receive different doses of TRC105 depending on when they enter the
           study, up to a maximum tolerated dose or optimum treatment dose.

        -  Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment, as well as other
           tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors. Participants will receive
           medicines to help prevent possible adverse side effects of TRC105, such as allergic
           reaction to the drug.

        -  Participants will continue treatment with TRC105 until they or the study team decides
           that the medication is not beneficial. No additional testing will be required unless
           participants discontinue the treatment because of side effects (which the study doctors
           will follow until the side effects are resolved).

      Background:

      - Inhibition of angiogenesis has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC). TRC105 is a human/murine chimeric immunoglobulin heavy constant
      gamma 1 (IgG1) kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to human CD105 (endoglin), thus
      inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth. Data from an ongoing phase I clinical trial
      suggest that TRC105 is well tolerated with evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with
      metastatic CRPC.

      Primary Objectives:

      - Define the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of TRC105 given every one to two weeks.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile of TRC105 given every one to
           two weeks

        -  Evaluate time to disease progression, overall response rate and overall survival.

        -  Describe the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate to therapy with TRC105

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of TRC105

        -  Demonstrate a biologic effect of TRC105 in the patient and, when possible, on the tumor
           via laboratory evaluation of the molecular markers of angiogenesis before and after
           drug administration respectively

      Eligibility:

        -  Progressive, castrate-resistant, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2

      Design:

      - An initial single-arm, phase I dose escalation study open to all patients with progressive
      metastatic CRPC. The study will evaluate patients in five cohorts of escalating dose levels.
      A maximum of 30 patients will be needed to complete the phase I evaluation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients must have histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer by the
                  Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pathology
                  Department of the National Naval Medical Center or Pathology Department of
                  Walter Reed Army Medical Center prior to entering this study. Patients whose
                  pathology specimens are no longer available may be enrolled in the trial if the
                  patient has a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer and available
                  documentation from an outside pathology laboratory of the diagnosis. In cases
                  where original tissue blocks or archival biopsy material is available, efforts
                  will be made to contact referring physicians and outside pathology departments
                  to have the material forwarded to the research team for use in correlative
                  studies.

               2. Patients must have metastatic progressive castrate-resistant prostate cancer
                  defined as progressive disease (see below) despite surgical castration or

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or
                  equal to 2.5 times upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times upper normal limits OR creatinine
                  clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with

                  Gault formula.

                  8. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior
                  therapy, including surgery. Toxicity should be less than or equal to grade 1 or

                  9. All patients who have not undergone bilateral surgical castration must
                  continue suppression of testosterone production by appropriate usage of
                  gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists.

                  10. Patients must not have other invasive malignancies (within the past 2 years
                  with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or non-invasive bladder cancer).

                  11. Enrolled patients must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
                  barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, the duration
                  of study participation and 3 months after the end of the treatment.

                  12. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed
                  consent document.

                  13. Patients on a stable dose of steroids of 10 mg/day or less can continue on
                  steroids if they are on peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis with an H2-blocker or
                  proton pump inhibitor.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients who have had chemotherapy, large field radiotherapy, or major surgery
                  must wait 3 weeks prior to entering the study.

               2. Patients may not be receiving any agents not approved by the Food and Drug
                  Administration (FDA) within the past 4 weeks.

               3. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
                  because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
                  neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and
                  other adverse events.

               4. Proteinuria, as demonstrated by a 24 hour protein of (Bullet) 2000 mg. Urine
                  protein will be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC). For UPC ratio
                  &gt; 1.0, a 24-hour urine protein will need to be obtained and the level should be
                  &lt; 2000 mg for patient enrollment.

               5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, hypertension

                  systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
                  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
                  limit compliance with study requirements.

               8. History of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis within 6 months of TRC105
                  administration, unless patient has received adequate treatment for peptic ulcer
                  disease and has evidence of complete resolution documented by
                  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
