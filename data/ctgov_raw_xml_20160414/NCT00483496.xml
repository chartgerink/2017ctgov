  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commercially available external photoprotectors (EP) do not provide adequate protection
      against ultraviolet A (UVA) and visible wavelengths. The proposed medicinal product V0096 CR
      (formula RV3131A-MV1166) is a broad spectrum EP (bsEP). The rationale for the use of V0096
      CR (formula RV3131A-MV1166) in the proposed condition is based on its ability to broadly
      block the UVA radiations and visible light that are known to trigger solar urticaria (SU).

    <description>MUD was defined as the minimal dose for occurrence of objective signs of SU (wheal, flare) under exposure to the solar simulator. Results are expressed as photodermatosis protection factor (PPF), calculated by dividing the MUD of protected skin (sessions 2 to 5) by the MUD of the unprotected skin (session 1) in each treatment group.
Procedure: At baseline, 4 grids of 8 adjacent test areas on the patient back were defined. The defined test areas of each grid were applied with the respective test products by the investigating staff at the beginning of each session, according to a predefined randomisation schedule. Grids were sequentially irradiated one by one with 1 MUD (session 2) , 3 MUD (session 3) , 5 MUD (session 4), and 7 MUD (session 5), respectively. After product removal at each session, patients were observed for 30 min for the development of SU lesions. Final reading of all areas was performed at the end of each session, by the investigator masked to product site assignment.</description>

        <title>Assessment of the Minimal Urticaria Dose (MUD) on Each Test Site, After Application of the Test Products</title>
        <description>MUD was defined as the minimal dose for occurrence of objective signs of SU (wheal, flare) under exposure to the solar simulator. Results are expressed as photodermatosis protection factor (PPF), calculated by dividing the MUD of protected skin (sessions 2 to 5) by the MUD of the unprotected skin (session 1) in each treatment group.
Procedure: At baseline, 4 grids of 8 adjacent test areas on the patient back were defined. The defined test areas of each grid were applied with the respective test products by the investigating staff at the beginning of each session, according to a predefined randomisation schedule. Grids were sequentially irradiated one by one with 1 MUD (session 2) , 3 MUD (session 3) , 5 MUD (session 4), and 7 MUD (session 5), respectively. After product removal at each session, patients were observed for 30 min for the development of SU lesions. Final reading of all areas was performed at the end of each session, by the investigator masked to product site assignment.</description>

            <title>Assessment of the Minimal Urticaria Dose (MUD) on Each Test Site, After Application of the Test Products</title>
            <description>MUD was defined as the minimal dose for occurrence of objective signs of SU (wheal, flare) under exposure to the solar simulator. Results are expressed as photodermatosis protection factor (PPF), calculated by dividing the MUD of protected skin (sessions 2 to 5) by the MUD of the unprotected skin (session 1) in each treatment group.
Procedure: At baseline, 4 grids of 8 adjacent test areas on the patient back were defined. The defined test areas of each grid were applied with the respective test products by the investigating staff at the beginning of each session, according to a predefined randomisation schedule. Grids were sequentially irradiated one by one with 1 MUD (session 2) , 3 MUD (session 3) , 5 MUD (session 4), and 7 MUD (session 5), respectively. After product removal at each session, patients were observed for 30 min for the development of SU lesions. Final reading of all areas was performed at the end of each session, by the investigator masked to product site assignment.</description>
