      Hypothesis:Anti-[18F]FACBC PET-CT will adequately detect local and extraprostatic
      recurrence, and lead to better characterization of disease status in restaging patients.

      This is a study that will test a compound (chemical substance) that has a small amount of
      radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to prostate
      tissue. The substance is called [18]FACBC and it is given in the form of an injection into a
      vein. After the substance reaches the prostate, scans called PET or Positron Emission
      Tomography, are done. This is similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound
      called [18]FDG is used for PET scans but this substance is eliminated by the kidneys and
      cannot reach the prostate. This substance called [18]FACBC is not eliminated by the kidneys
      and may allow tumors in the prostate to be seen better. It is sometimes difficult to tell if
      a growth on the prostate is cancer with scans or x-rays that are usually done.

      This study will look at how the [18]FACBC goes into the prostate tissue and determine its
      ability to detect recurrent prostate cancer.

             localized disease.

          -  In the case of brachytherapy, cryotherapy, or external beam radiation, treatment will
             have occurred at least 2 years in the past to eliminate patients with so-called &quot;PSA
             bump.&quot;

          -  Patient will have suspicion of recurrent prostate carcinoma as defined by: ASTRO
             criteria of three consecutive rises of PSA or earlier if clinically appropriate,
             and/or nadir + 2.0 after radiotherapy, and/or greater than 0.3 after prostatectomy.

          -  Ability to lie still for PET scanning

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18.

          -  Greater than T3 disease in past

          -  Prior prostatectomy or 2 years since brachytherapy, cryotherapy, or external beam
             radiation therapy.

          -  Does not meet above criteria of suspicious PSA elevation

          -  Inability to lie still for PET scanning

          -  Cannot provide written informed consent.

          -  Bone scan findings characteristic for metastatic prostate carcinoma

          -  Less than 2 months since any prior prostate biopsy (to decrease false positive uptake
             from inflammation).
