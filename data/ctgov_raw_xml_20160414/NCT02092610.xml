      An international multicentre, open, comparative, parallel group, prospective clinical
      investigation with a single 5 year follow up visit.

      Two implant products, the standard implant and abutment and the novel implant and abutment,
      both developed by Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB were tested in the CAG5173 clinical
      investigation that was completed in December 2012. The primary objective was to show
      superiority of the novel implant compared to standard implant in terms of implant stability
      quotient (ISQ) as as measured by resonance frequency analysis1. Results after 6 and 36
      months after implantation showed that the new design, the novel implant and abutment,
      provided statistically significantly higher stability at the time of insertion and over time
      compared to the standard Baha implant2,3,4. In the investigation, sound processor fitting
      was performed from 6 weeks post-implantation. No reduction in implant stability following
      sound processor fitting was recorded, suggesting that it is safe to load the implant 6 weeks
      after implantation. The investigation also showed improved soft tissue outcomes, in terms of
      lower Holgers index5 scores for the novel implant and abutment compared to the standard
      implant and abutment.

      After initiation of the 3-year CAG5173 investigation, Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB
      launched the Cochlear Baha BIA300 Implant and Abutment, which in all critical aspects are
      identical to the novel implant used in the investigation.

      The 36-month visit was the last visit of the investigation. Hence, no further visits were
      planned or scheduled for the subjects participating in that investigation.participating
      subjects. It is of clinical and scientific interest to evaluate the clinical performance and
      safety data of the implants in these subjects after an additional two-year period, in order
      to gain additional understanding of how implant stability and soft tissue status evolves
      over time with the two implant and abutment designs, and in order to evaluate long-term
      implant survival. No randomised controlled investigation of Baha implants with a 5-year
      follow-up has been conducted to date.

      The rationale behind this clinical investigation is to collect long term stability, survival
      and tolerability data of a novel Baha implant system 5 years after implantation in a
      population that previously have been followed in a completed controlled investigation during
      a 3 year period. The collected data will enable comparison with the data gathered in the
      previous completed CAG5173 clinical investigation.

    <description>To show superiority of the novel implant compared to standard implants regarding stability of the implants measured as ISQ values at the abutment level. The ISQ value ranges from 1 to 100, the higher ISQ value, the higher the implant stabilty. Mean AUC 0-60 months ISQ represents a weighted average of the implant stability during the 60 months from start of the CAG5173 study to the measurement in this study CBAS5562. The ISQ 5 years value represents the single ISQ measurment at 5 years.</description>

    <description>To compare the long term survival of the novel implant and abutment and the standard implant and abutment in the Baha system.
All patients will be asked if they have experienced any implant osseointegration problems which would have made the implant to get loose. The time from implant implantation until implant loss or removal will be collected. In case of implant removal, reason for removal shall be recorded.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the status of the soft tissue at the implant site.
The scale Holgers Index 4 is designed to capture signs and symptoms of inflammation or infection at the site of implantation. The scale should be completed at the visit.
The scale consists of the following steps:
0. No irritation. Epidermal debris removed, if present
Slight redness. Local temporary treatment, if needed
Red and slightly moist tissue. No granulation formation, local treatment and extra controls as indicated
Reddish and moist; sometimes granulations tissue, revision surgery is indicated
Removal of the abutment/implant necessary due to infection R. Removal of abutment/implant for reasons not related to skin problems</description>

            <description>To show superiority of the novel implant compared to standard implants regarding stability of the implants measured as ISQ values at the abutment level. The ISQ value ranges from 1 to 100, the higher ISQ value, the higher the implant stabilty. Mean AUC 0-60 months ISQ represents a weighted average of the implant stability during the 60 months from start of the CAG5173 study to the measurement in this study CBAS5562. The ISQ 5 years value represents the single ISQ measurment at 5 years.</description>

The scale Holgers Index 4 is designed to capture signs and symptoms of inflammation or infection at the site of implantation. The scale should be completed at the visit.
The scale consists of the following steps:
0. No irritation. Epidermal debris removed, if present
Slight redness. Local temporary treatment, if needed
Red and slightly moist tissue. No granulation formation, local treatment and extra controls as indicated
Reddish and moist; sometimes granulations tissue, revision surgery is indicated
