  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response to an additional dose (challenge dose) of hepatitis B vaccine, when
      given to subjects who had received primary vaccination of Engerix™-B vaccine approximately
      72-78 months ago.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the challenge phase. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female who had received complete primary vaccination course of hepatitis B
             vaccine in the primary study

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject and/or parent/guardian of the
             subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential or if she is of
             childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to
             vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2
             months after the hepatitis B challenge dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational/non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
             vaccine within 30 days preceding the hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose or planned

             challenge dose and ending 30 days after.

          -  Subjects who received an additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine outside the context
             of the study between the primary vaccination course and the hepatitis B challenge
             vaccination visit.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study

             non-investigational product.

             the vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on

             determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose or planned administration during the
             study period (one month).

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.
